First application, I loved the wand to apply the product. It didn’t win me over first try, I didn’t like the way my eyelashes looked at first. Then as I continued to apply it after a few days I did seek to like it more and more. It made my eyelashes look full. One thing to note, this mascara is NOT waterproof."

Only thing is, it does hold my lashes up but only after I went back in with my lash curler. When its first applied it will weigh your lashes down and you will have to go in and curl them again, if you're looking for something that will hold without having to go back in with your lash curler I don't suggest this for you, but i think it's a good product."

This is the first product that I have ever tried from Fenty. As someone who has very straight lashes it is so hard to find a good mascara. This works super well with my lashes I usually curl them with my shiseido eyelash curler then go in with the first coat let it dry curl again and so on with a second coat and omg it does wonders. It makes my eyelashes super nice and voluminous. I love that you can add several coats and it does no clump. This product definitely makes me want to try out more fenty products! So far I am impressed and this is only one product from the line. Can’t wait to try more!

It feels on a drier side for me, and I had some fall outs. I used to have Fenty FULL FRONTAL VOLUME, LIFT & CURL MASCARA, and this one I really loved. It was perfect for me, especially how it curled up my lashes.
The Hella Thick isn’t impressive for me, I wouldn’t buy it for myself."

Putting it on was nice, smooth not clumpy. Length added was pretty good. I took a picture with one eye done and one not for comparison. It lasted all day and didn’t flake. Only down fall, I don’t always wash my make up off at night, and this mascara smears pretty bad! Not the worst I’ve used, but definitely worst than my regular go-to mascara. I had to use a makeup wipe first thing in the morning where I normally wait and wash my face after coffee. It was also on my pillowcase, which again, isn’t normal for me. If you wash before bed, no problem and good go to!"

I am so bummed out by this mascara. I love Fenty Beauty and I was so excited to try this. I have used this one time and will most likely not be using it again. 

Pros of this mascara: 
I loved the simple packaging and how when you set the mascara down- you can set it however (standing up or on its side). It has beveled edges to stay put instead of being completely  circular like other mascaras. 

This mascara is VERY black in color. The shade it came in is called “cuz I’m black”. It is noticeably blacker than a lot of my other mascaras that are in the blackest shade available. 

This did a great job at lengthening my lashes and giving them tons of volume. No complaints there.

This mascara has a bit of a flowery scent to it. I didn’t hate it but it wasn’t that noticeable. 

Cons: 
The formula is so creamy that it doesn’t hold a curl. It’s has no hold to it. I have incredibly straight eyelashes and need a mascara that hold curl and this is most definitely not that. 

I have combination skin and dryer/normal under eyes and this transferred like CRAZY under my eyes. It made me look like a raccoon within about 2 hours.

I thought this mascara dyed my lashes very very black which isn’t a complaint. But turns out it’s just because it’s incredibly hard to get off all the way and lingers for days if you don’t scrub it off. I typically don’t have to “scrub off” my mascara in order to get it all off. Every time I thought I got it all off- I had to think again because it wouldn’t come off of my lashes. I think this is due to how incredibly creamy and pigmented this mascara is. 


Overall this mascara is not for me. I do not recommend it due to the reasons above. However, it did a great job at giving my lashes  volume, length and darkening."

While my lashes did look a bit longer, I didn’t get the thickness I expected. They ended up looking more separated and thin, which isn’t my usual preference. I also think the wand might not be the best choice for achieving full thickness—it didn’t seem to pick up or distribute enough product to build volume. If you prefer a more natural, lengthened look, this could work, but it’s not the dramatic effect I usually go for."

I thought others were great but this one blew them away. 
**I received this product in exchange for my honest review**
You can see with the pic posted just how well it coats the lash and makes your eyes pop! It’s easy to apply, no clumping on the lashes. I’ve found it stays put way better than other products I’ve used. The price is amazing for the quality, I’ll certainly be buying again when this one runs out. The brush applies the product evenly, for me one application is all that’s needed. I do think using an eyelash curler first would really look great. No irritation and easy to remove at the end of the day."

I have short, straight lashes and I didn't find this more volumizing than any other mascara. However, I did find that it makes my lashes extremely fluttery and curled and it lasts all day. It's a drier formula with a narrower brush, which makes it very easy to get the mascara all the way down to my lash roots and keep all my lashes separated. I don't believe this is waterproof, but I haven't noticed any smudging and it comes off easily and cleanly with cleansing balm. And a tiny detail, but the tube is a sort of prism, which is great because it doesn't roll away. 

My only con is that it does tend to leave little uneven clumps and bits. A quick pass over with the wand will remove/cover them, but it does take some extra care and patience."

One of my favorite features? It stayed put all day—no smudging, even after a long wear test. Yet, when it was time to remove it, it came off easily with micellar water.

The first test I did to try it out, was taking the application wand and seeing if I could get a good application with just a single dip.  I was able to get a decent every-day amount of mascara on both of my lashes using just a single wand of product! It’s also a very buildable mascara—I have 2 coats on in my review pictures and I think that’s the perfect amount of drama for some “Oomph” in your look without going over the top for the office or workplace. The formula also has a lot of staying power—I tried it out as a solo product and even without any setting spray or other products, there was minimal fallout or flaking by end of day.

I also liked the shape of the wand, the geometric body and top shape make holding onto the wand a lot easier than some more standard/circular product designs. Overall I’m stoked that I had chance to test this product out and looking forward to integrating it into my routine!"

I have fairly long lashes and typically use a volumizing drugstore mascara. I've read other reviews saying this mascara was clumpy. I didn't find it to be clumpy as long as I wiggled the brush from root to tip with every stroke. I found any clumps would disappear after that. As far as whether it added volume, I think my drugstore mascara did that better. This mascara provided more length than volume. The black is a very good black. There was minimal flaking after being on all day. I didn't experience any eye irritation and I have sensitive eyes. Overall, I still think there are drugstore mascaras that can provide the same effects. I don't think you need to spend this amount of money on a mascara."

Also, you will need an eye makeup remover to fully remove this mascara as just using face wash will leave you with raccoon eyes."

I haven’t tried a high end mascara before this. I have really straight lashes and it’s really hard to hold a curl. For anyone else who struggles with this - I add a little vaseline on a curler before curling and it really helps keep them up. Then I usually apply the mascara. Anyway, I wore this on Thanksgiving and my lashes managed to stay curled all day. The brush is thick and tapers slightly toward the top. For me personally - maybe I haven’t been adding enough, but it doesn’t seem super volumizing. It did lengthen a lot though. I honestly do like the effect. My usual go to mascara is L’oréal Lash Paradise and I feel like it looks similar. I do honestly think I will consider repurchasing once running out."

The value is also pretty great honestly. It’s not overpriced

The cons- 
The packaging doesn’t state if it’s waterproof or not. 
It did run just a little with sweat, but not much at all and wasn’t really noticeable to anyone else.
I wish the wand was a little curved or spread out to really pull the length, but even so, it still did an amazing job.

But the 2nd time the brush was full of clumps that transferred to my lashes. Once I wiped off the top and the brush it was fine. So I highly recommend doing that after each use. Other than that I do love it! As much as I liked her other one I like this even more. And the price is excellent too! I highly recommend it!

I was really excited about this one, but it just didn’t stand the test of time. 

The good:
The brush is amazing, like I’m going to steal this for future mascara applications. The formula is super light, easy to apply and very buildable. Gives great volume, definition, and stays lifted for forever. 

The bad: 
It was definitely dark and smudged under my bottom lash line by dinner time. Not black flakes, dark pigment that looks like dark circles but melted out. I have oily skin, but I figured it would have more staying power than that."

This mascara isn’t bad by any means, it lengthens your lashes, defines them, and is a true black shade, but there’s nothing special about it. For the price you’re paying, there is much better out there. L’Oreal Voluminous is very similar, with less clumping, and costs half the price as this. I do like the unique bottle shape, although it can be a bit bulky. The way the wand feels in your hand is great. Overall, decent product, but isn’t transformative, and there is better for your money."

I really like this,5 Dec 2024,Jillian420,"So I don’t know if this was reformulated or if I’m misremembering, but I distinctly remember thinking this was clumpy and not right for me, but I really enjoy this now. I like the shape and how it doesn’t roll off a countertop. It really lengthens and lifts my lashes without much smear. The price isn’t bad either. I can sometimes get headaches from certain mascaras and I’m yet to identify an ingredient or scent that triggers it, this is comfortable though. Keep in mind I have thick, long lashes that are stick straight and sometimes even droop, so if you’re a sparse lash girly you may have a different experience."

My eyelashes are stick straight so I have to curl them daily and they don't curl easily. Finding a mascara that won't make them droop is tough. I usually can't apply mascara at the base of my lashes or they'll instantly droop so I just apply at the tips and slowly work down the lash, and apply as many coats until they look good. This mascara was a game changer! I applied just one coat and it went on thick and the color is a deep rich black. I absolutely loved the results! The best part was that there was no fallout! None! I've never had a mascara stay put as long as this one did. It survived one of my worse seasonal allergy days, the insane humidity in Texas, my constant eye rubbing and it even survived when I put on my eyedrops. What can I say? I'm OBSESSED!

It doesn't irritate my eyes, or flake or smudge even though I tend to not bother with setting spray most days and I rub my eyes sometimes.

Two light coats is all you need to get Hella Thicc lashes. It goes on thick & wet, and immediately thickens lashes. It doesn't lengthen much, but it only takes one light swipe to get thick, dark lashes. The brush holds a lot of product, and I can do both eyes top & bottom without needing to dip back into the container. The formula is very wet, and will transfer to lids if you aren't careful during application, or if you open your eyes too wide before it dries, but it does dry relatively quick.  Because of the formula, the next morning I did have a bit of smudging on the lower lids, but not too much. 
The packaging is cute but doesn't allow the bottle to stand upright, which isn't a big deal to me. I received this in exchange for my opinion, but the retail price is really fair and I do like this mascara, so I would definitely repurchase at full price.

I didn’t really notice any flaking but after wearing for 7 hours I did notice some smudging under my eyes. I attached a photo of my top lashes without and then with 2 coats of mascara. I’m a huge mascara person and would purchase with my own money. The price isn’t bad either. $19.00 US dollars. If you’re in the market for a new mascara it’s worth a try.

I normally wear waterproof mascara but this one claimed to be sweat, humidity, and transfer-proof so I gave it a try. The packaging was a major let down. I like the shape, but it felt of similar quality to a covergirl mascara, definitely not something worth $19. The product itself is nothing special, very basic fluffy wand that was not great for separation. The formula wasn’t a hit for me either - didn’t hold a curl and definitely not any type of “proof” because just sitting at my work desk all day, it was smudged under my eyes by the end of the day.

I LOVED Full Frontal, that one looked like lash extensions. It had zero flaking, smudging or clumping but I guess a lot of people had bad experiences with it. I don’t know what happened there because when I bought it, it was genuinely the best mascara I’d ever used and I’m not young or new to makeup, I’ve tried many! I’m sad that instead of investigating they scrapped the whole product and replaced it with this one. Now this one I do NOT understand. It’s definitely one of the worst mascaras. Smudging, flaking and clumping is all I got from this. I also liked the other wand better.

I’ve been going through chemotherapy for breast cancer for the last few months and my lashes are sparse and short. Id tried a handful of mascaras in the last month or two and was always let down by promises of volume, length, and curl. 
This mascara is extremely black which I love and was super helpful in making the few lashes I do have stand out. The brush is nice and really gripped onto the base of my lashes making it easy to coat even the ones in the corner of my eye. This mascara really delivers on volume and finally made me feel like I didn’t have to apply falsies to wear eyeshadow. I’m super excited to see how amazing this truly is when my lashes grow back after chemo. I did take away a star because i don’t completely love how this dries down; after 6-8 hours of wear it became flaky for me."

I have naturally long eyelashes with zero curl to them. In fact, my eyelashes are stubbornly straight. Usually, I can curl them with an eyelash curler, apply mascara, and they will be absolutely flat again within fifteen minutes. I have had some success with one previous mascara adding some curl to them, but it was nothing like the results from the Hella Thicc mascara. This mascara not only gave the appearance of thicker lashes,  but it added a beautiful, full curl to my lashes. Even more impressive is the fact that my lashes stay curled. The formula of this mascara is absolutely beautiful. This mascara goes on easily and smoothly. There is zero clumping even with multiple coats applied. The brush is simple, yet effective and catches even the smallest of lashes. Overall, I highly recommend giving this mascara a try!"

From the moment I tried it, I was impressed by its ability t
o deliver a dramatic lash transformation without any clumping or heaviness.

One of the standout features of this mascara is its unique formula. It effortlessly coats each lash from root to tip, adding impressive volume that gives the illusion of fuller lashes. The mascara's wand is thoughtfully designed, with densely packed bristles that grab onto every lash, ensuring even distribution and avoiding any unsightly clumps.

I was thrilled to find that the Hella Thicc Mascara didn't flake or smudge throughout the day, maintaining its bold effect from morning to night. Whether I was attending a busy workday or a fun night out, my lashes remained voluminous and eye-catching.

Another noteworthy aspect is the deep black color the mascara offers. It adds an intense richness to my lashes, framing my eyes beautifully and enhancing their natural depth.

While the mascara provides impressive volume, it's also versatile. For a more natural look, a single coat works wonders, while applying an extra layer or two offers a striking, high-impact effect that's perfect for special occasions or when you want to make a statement.

In terms of removal, the mascara was surprisingly easy to take off with my regular makeup remover. It didn't require excessive rubbing or tugging, which is a big plus for maintaining healthy lashes.

Overall, the Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara lives up to its name. If you're on the hunt for a mascara that delivers remarkable volume, a deep black color, and lasting performance, this one is definitely worth adding to your makeup collection. Get ready to embrace bold, stunning lashes that are sure to turn heads wherever you go!"

However, this review reflects my true opinion.

I currently have several Fenty items that I love and use as apart of my go to makeup routine, so I was very excited to try the new Fenty Hella Thicc Mascara! This mascara gave my lashes volume and length without being clumpy or heavy. The effect of the mascara was very natural looking and definitely gave my eyes a little bit of pop.

For application, I brushed my lashes with a clean spoolie, applied 1 coat of mascara, and then brushed through again with a clean spoolie. 

Other reviewers noted that the mascara flaked/smudged. I didn’t experience any flaking or smudging, but I only used a light coat and was not sweating or anything like that. 

Overall, would recommend!"

Occasionally I’ll do some mascara and some lip gloss. I bought this based on a recommendation from a Sephora employee and some of the ladies at work asked if I had gotten lash extensions. It’s incredibly thick and volumizing and it does look like lash extensions when I put it on. The only downside for me is that I can actually see my lashes in my peripheral because the product is so thick. I have not experienced any smudging so far after wearing for 3 days at work but I also haven’t been sweating heavily or anything.

It's a heavy formula so if you don't curly your lashes repeatedly, they will fall flat.  Also, while the brush is good, the wiper is crap.  It leaves wayyyyy too much product on the wand.  Like, blobs of it, which results in super clumpy application.  Thin coats are where it's at to build volume.  If I have to wipe the wand to get it to apply properly, it's a waste of product and too much work IMO.  I want to apply my mascara, comb through to separate and be done.

This is my first non-drugstore mascara and I noticed a difference in volume and length compared to what I normally use (Covergirl).

I noticed a tiny bit of under-eye smudging after an entire evening out, but not nearly as much as I’d have with other mascaras. I didn’t really notice any clumping and thought it dried quickly :)

This mascara is a really great upgrade if you’re used to drugstore brands, especially for the price! It maybe wouldn’t be the best choice for those who are used to higher-end mascara that does not smudge."

I have mixed feelings about this mascara. Yes, it makes my lashes really thick and voluminous, but it takes a long time to get it to look good. I appreciate some clumps for more volume, but this mascara looks TOO clumpy at first. With other mascaras, I'm brushing my lashes with the wand to add more product, but with this mascara, the wand adds too much product at once and I'm brushing with the wand to brush out the clumps. But once I finish combing through, my lashes look nice and thick. I also don't like that no matter how careful I try to be, I always end up with product on my eyelids.

It is really buildable so the first layer you put on looks very light and natural but with each stroke you get a more dramatic look so it’s great for every day or nights out. It has a really nice consistency so it doesn’t clump or stick to the lashes but glides on so smoothly. I don’t think I've ever used a mascara that has gone on so smoothly. I would definitely recommend. Since it is more smooth do make sure you wait till it dries because I did notice I got some on my under eye accidentally! It is great for both lengthening and adding volume to your lashes since each layer looks more voluminous. I would definitely recommend!

It goes on smoothly and lengthens and lifts my eyelashes more than other products I've used before. The lift is especially noticeable. It does seem to take longer to dry when it is applied, so I have to be careful not to get little smudges, but once it is on it stays ON. I've worn it through an entire workday and to late events, and it is still on and not flaking off by the time I get home at night. The applicator really separates and lifts lashes. The tube itself is a very cool geometric/gem design, and the applicator/lid closes with a really satisfying click. Loved it!"

I'm so disappointed with this mascara. I only had 1 try to get the mascara on my lashes because It is so black and goopy and clumps my lashes together.

It really does make a difference! I received a sample of this mascara, but the 5 stars is not because I got the sample. I immediately loved the bristles. It doesn't look clumpy and I didn't need to dip the mascara back in. With the bristles, I really felt every eyelash getting brushed with mascara on them. It didn't make my eyelash longer, but it definitely gave off the illusion they were thicker and longer (very fluttery). I curled my eyelashes before applying too and they didn't uncurl after wearing the mascara all day. It did rub off under my eyes during the day, but I feel that's with most mascaras. Out of curiosity, after I came back home for the day, I went straight to the shower without using makeup remover, most of the mascara fell off, and there was some residue under my eyes and my eyelids. I ended up using makeup remover after that. 

On the picture of me holding the mascara was me wearing the whole day. The daylight picture was when I was wearing the mascara for about 5-6 hours"

The actual container the mascara is in is also nice because it is shaped differently and has some weight to it.  It is also easy to hold.  When I first applied the mascara, it started a little clumpy but I thought maybe just because it is brand new that this was the case.  I tried to wipe it off on the rim of the container a little.  Once it wasn't as lumpy it did go on my lashes pretty nicely without having much clumps.  I also did not have to reapply multiple coats for it to lengthen my lashes which also saved time.  I put it on one side of my face just to compare it to the side without any mascara and it definitely made a difference.
I wore it around the house the entire day and it lasted for the most part, except there was a little black that had accumulated underneath my eye.  My other mascaras wear very well throughout the day and I would be worried this one might run somewhat and I would need to keep checking the mirror.  By the end of the day, my lashes didn't seem as black or volumized as they initially were.  I guess this is also not waterproof because as soon as my face got wet, it really ran down my face. The good news is that it was very easy to get off with makeup remover and did not leave a residue on my lashes.  Overall, it went on smoothly and looked good at first but if you are planning to wear it for an entire day I don't know if this is the product for you.  I will try it one more time when I am going out somewhere for a short time period but not for an important event.  I am going to stick with my Thrive Causemetics mascara for now but I do appreciate the invite to try this mascara."

I love it so far Compared to other mascaras available in the market, this product stands out due to its ability to add volume and length to lashes without clumping or smudging. The unique formula is infused with nourishing ingredients such as jojoba oil, which helps to keep lashes healthy and strong.
One of the benefits of owning this product is that it can give you a dramatic lash look that lasts all day long. The wand is designed to separate and coat each lash, providing a bold and voluminous effect. Additionally, the formula is long-lasting and water-resistant, making it ideal for all-day wear.
If you're someone who loves voluminous and dramatic lashes, then the Fenty Voluminous Mascara is definitely worth trying!! However, if you prefer a more natural look, then this mascara may not be the right fit for you.
Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high-quality mascara that can add volume and length to their lashes."

I'm a mascara snob and absolutely love Hella Thicc. I wear mascara just about every day, even if I'm not wearing any other makeup. I don't wear falsies, so a quality mascara that consistently performs is important. 

Hella Thicc gave me volume and length! One coat and I was satisfied for a day of errands. I prefer my lashes to clump together, but I hate when the product is clumpy. Hella Thicc lightly clumped, without leaving behind tons of product. 

The color is a true jet black, dried quickly, and was flake free. There was minimal transfer after 60 seconds, and there was no transfer throughout the day. It was easy to remove, my lashes didn't feel weighed down, and I didn't notice any missing/pulled lashes after removal.

Will definitely be a staple in my rotation."

I love it so far Compared to other mascaras available in the market, this product stands out due to its ability to add volume and length to lashes without clumping or smudging. The unique formula is infused with nourishing ingredients such as jojoba oil, which helps to keep lashes healthy and strong.
One of the benefits of owning this product is that it can give you a dramatic lash look that lasts all day long. The wand is designed to separate and coat each lash, providing a bold and voluminous effect. Additionally, the formula is long-lasting and water-resistant, making it ideal for all-day wear.
If you're someone who loves voluminous and dramatic lashes, then the Fenty Voluminous Mascara is definitely worth trying!! However, if you prefer a more natural look, then this mascara may not be the right fit for you.
Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high-quality mascara that can add volume and length to their lashes."
