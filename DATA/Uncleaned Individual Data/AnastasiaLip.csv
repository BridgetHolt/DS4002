I’m going to see if I can use different glosses to see if I can manipulate it to look good

I'm sort of a makeup addict, I've tried hundreds of lipsticks in my day and this formula really is something unique. It's matte but not drying, it stays on for hours and it just makes your lips look amazing, fuller. They feel almost like a powdery gel? It's hard to describe, but extremely comfortable. Even the applicator is nice, it comes to a point so you can get a nice crisp line. I can't say enough good things about these!

I heard these were kinda dry and it was someone I worked with so i trusted her opinion. BIG MISTAKE....when she came out with these darker beautiful colors later on. I was like wow. I knew these had silk and that's not an drying ingredient. Itnhelps smooth your skin, and condition. The trick with these is you must put on a thin layer and DO NOT rub your lips. You pat it on if you need more or smoothing out. I've never had an issue with smudging. Now I wanna try with her lip glosses a bit nervous but she usually formulates everything to mesh well. I'm gonna put a light amount of lip gloss and I'm hoping it won't smear. I bought Rosy Mauve and im so impressed because the color is not you're typical rose mauve. I typically don't like these colors but this HAS DEPTH. And I'm a medium to high contrast.  So light to medium tone, darker hazel eyes, dark brown hair. I feel this color will compliment more skin tones. Good job ABH!","19 Oct 2024","Great formulation","KoreanEwok"

It was my absolute favourite nude pink for me because it was a warmer pink shade that didn’t wash me out. I also liked the formula because it had a “softer” looking effect on the lips that is different from lipstick and felt good on the lips. 

I gave this product a try (shade: Pure Hollywood) and swatched next to each other, they are very similar (ABH on the left, Tarte on the right). I would say the tarte one is maybe a shade darker and a touch warmer/peachier, however I still absolutely love Pure Hollywood. It’s not an exact dupe for the colour, but it is a relatively similar formula that applies like butter and gives that soft, diffused look on the lips. It slightly emphasizes the lines on my lips in the photo cause my lips are a tad dry, but I find in person they look flawless. I think it has pretty good staying power as well, compared to the tarte one, especially considering it isn’t transfer proof or anything. 

I am overall super happy with this product as it does make me feel beautiful and I’d love to try some more shades 🫶","15 Sep 2024","","LynnNhi"

First off, I absolutely LOVE the texture of this formula. It is a nice matte liquid lipstick that feels soft on my lips and doesn't dry them out at all. This particular shade (Crush) didn't work as well for my specific skin tone as I had hoped, however I could see it working really well for someone with a different complexion. It is worth noting that I personally tend to go for more pinky nudes and this shade is more of a true beige (as described), so this shade is also a little bit outside of my comfort zone and it may work well for you if you are looking for a true soft beige and find that those types of shades complement you. 

Overall, I give this a 10/10 on formula, application, and color payoff. I won't count the shade-fit itself (for me personally) against the product as a whole because I think that this is really more a matter of personal preference on my end, rather than a reflection on the product itself. Looking at their other available shades, I already see some shades that I think would work better for me and that I would be excited to try--I think both Pure Hollywood and Kiss would probably be solid picks for my complexion and personal preferences. 

Definitely a product worth trying if you are looking for a new matte liquid lipstick.","6 May 2024","","KristenKay524"

The formula of this Velvet lipstick has its pros and cons, but for me personally it has more cons to it. While the color is pigmented, and the application is pretty easy, it's not long-lasting at all, moreover it's drying, which was a major disappointment for me. It does feel weightless at first, no stickiness, but the lipstick disappears from your lips quickly, easily transfers to everything and leaves your lips dry. That's not what I'm looking for in my lip products. 
Additionally, orange undertones don't work well for my pale skin, thus I wasn't excited about the color either.","14 Mar 2024","Not a fan","Ginger007"

Yes. This is that-- but the luxury version. I have Parchment (too warm for my skin) and Crush (which similar to the vibe that the London/Abu Dhabi shades give from the NYX). But when I say it's long wearing, I mean it! I apply it in the morning and it lasts through my work day, lunch, the gym (and sauna), until I shower. It doesn't cause peeling either, but make sure your lips are moisturized prior because it is soooo much thicker than the NYX.

In the picture I am wearing Crush, the lighter of the two. This product if quite different then anything I've used before. It's not a liquid lip that doesn't transfer. It a whipped concestancy that performs like a regular tube lipstick when it comes longevity. The texture is interesting, didn't hate it but I think some might. I'm really not sure who the target audience is for this product. It's definitely a quality product that if it fits your needs I would recommend. The packaging is plastic but a very nice quality plastic that almost feels like glass. It feels so good just holding it! The color range is a bit small with mostly nude tones. Maybe they plan to add more colors later. I will definitely continue to use the two shades.","11 Feb 2024","It's Different...","MandaKayH"

I'm also a fan of matte lipstick, and this one was no exception! It glided on easily and didn't feel dry on my lips like alot of matte products do for the lips.

The formula of these liquid lipsticks are smooth and not too drying. I like that it gives more of a blurred mousse look instead of a drying matte look. Keep in mind they are not transfer proof.

My biggest issue is the colors/shade range. They seem like they would fit fair skinned people more. I'm pale but I still find that the colors look off on me and unflattering. Even the darkest shade out of this collection is still pretty light. Maybe it would look fine with a lip liner or a darker color on the outside, but I don't usually use a lip liner.

These are opaque liquid lipsticks that have a soft matte finish - little goes a long way. My lips were more dry than usual while using these lipsticks, however, all liquid lipstick gives me chapped lips. I applied a gloss over the lipsticks and that seemed to help immensely.

I did notice that the texture on application is nice and almost like a mousse texture but it can be easy to apply too much and can feel thick and cakey. I think the key is to apply a small amount and maybe even pat it down with some tissue to remove excess product. It’s not advertised as being transfer proof.

I received two velvet mousse matte lipsticks recently from Anastasia Beverly Hills. I .    The shade named Crush is a soft beige color, and it's beautiful with my Fair skintone! The second shade is named Parchment, which is a peachy brown color, which also is a stunning color. I believe that Parchment would be a universal color for all different Skintones and ethnicities. 
The color Crush is better suited for lighter Skintones, in my honest opinion, but it is still very pretty.  These matte lipsticks apply very well, and I love that the applicator is versatile. You additionally can use the applicator to act as a Lipliner by outlining your lips first and then filling in the rest of Your Lips with either lipstick. You also can use a darker shade such as Parchment to outline, and then use a lighter color like Crush to fill in Your lips. 
The texture feels heavenly, unlike most other Matte lipsticks that I use. It feels soft like Mousse.  Both of these products feel comfortable, and after some time, I didn't even remember that I had them on.  These lipsticks lasted through three separate meals! Overall, these lipsticks give a youthful look and look absolutely seamless! Overall, I highly recommend these lipsticks to other novices and professionals alike! As always, Anastasia beverly Hills created new high-quality products again! Thank you so much. Overall, I'm very happy!","2 Feb 2024","LIp velvet liquid lipstick","italiaprncess28"

I received crush and parchment for testing purposes, and I like them both, but the shades are a little different from what I expected from the swatch online. It lasted about 4 hours on me comfortably. I love the applicator brush—it works really well to smooth the pigment across my lips and to line them with the little tip point.

I received these products for free in exchange for my honest review, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.

First and foremost, what stood out to me about these lipsticks is how hydrating they are. As someone who typically avoids matte lipsticks due to their tendency to dry out my lips, I was pleasantly surprised by the formula of the Lip Velvet. It glided on smoothly and kept my lips moisturized throughout the day. The hydration factor is truly remarkable for a matte lipstick.

Now, let's talk about the colors. Parchment and Crush are both stunning neutral shades that complement a variety of skin tones. Parchment is a beautiful nude shade that adds a touch of sophistication to any makeup look. On the other hand, Crush is a lovely mauve shade that adds a subtle pop of color without being too bold. I appreciate how versatile these shades are, making them suitable for both everyday wear and special occasions.

The pigmentation of these lipsticks is top-notch. With just one swipe, you get a rich, opaque color payoff that lasts for hours. Even after eating and drinking, the color remained intact, which is a testament to the longevity of the Lip Velvet formula.

In terms of application, the lipsticks come in a convenient tube with a precise doe-foot applicator. The applicator allows for easy and precise application, ensuring that you can achieve a flawless look with minimal effort.

Overall, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in the shades Parchment and Crush. These lipsticks offer a rare combination of hydration and long-lasting color, making them a must-have in any makeup collection. Whether you're a fan of matte lipsticks or someone looking to try them for the first time, the Lip Velvet range is definitely worth exploring.

The consistency reminds me of the Sephora soft matte easy liquid lipstick, but slightly better. I’m a deep complexion girlie, think Kelly Rowland’s complexion. I tried with and without liner, but I feel like Parchment-Peachy Brown it just slightly blends into the skin, kinda gives a washed out looked. Now Crush on the hand, LOVE IT!

It goes on thick like a lip cream. The pigment is wonderful and never streaky, it glides on with ease and is so smooth. It smells nice like cookies and cream or cookie dough. It feels pretty weightless on the lips and is very comfortable. It dries down matte but not drying at all and doesn’t sink into fine lines. It actually does the opposite and has this blurring/soft focus effect which is so pretty. The doe applicator is really nice, the tapered top is great for shaping your lips and the centered flat side applies the cream on the lips effortlessly. Definitely the most hydrating matte lip I’ve tried in a while. It reminds me a little of NYX soft matte lip, with its cookie dough similar scent. I love how pigmented the colors are, they are very bold but still wearable making it perfect for both every day wear or an evening out. They aren’t budge proof but I don’t mind reapplying. When they did fade, they left almost a tint behind which is nice and looks more natural. They layered pretty well and didn’t flake or strip the color off while applying a new layer on top. It came off while I ate but that was expected. Its lasting power was around 4-5 hours. The packaging is so sleek, refined and sturdy. I love the gold touches and it fits in any purse making it great to take with you. I love that it’s cruelty free and cannot wait to try the other colors they have especially the more nude ones. I would recommend to those looking for a hydrating matte lip that feels comfortable on the lips and that is highly pigmented","1 Feb 2024","Feels soft on the lips, non drying!","Grootmom1724"

They're gorgeous and thick, but have no staying power, especially if you talk a lot or hydrate yourself. They're creamy, and super pigmented and crisp. I love parchment and crush, and I do find myself reaching for them when I need a boooold lip choice without care of how long it stays. They're not sticky, they glide really well and once they dry down, they don't transfer really. They're a lot like Rare's lip souffles in terms of texture and staying power.

I only wish the applicator was bigger and more fluffy. The one it comes with is one the smaller side and a bit stiff but not overly hard so it is still fine. It not being overly big is also okay since it helps get a more precise coverage of the sides of the mouth. My lips in particular are fuller in the middle and thinner on the sides so all in all I guess the applicator is okay as is. I hope there is more colors coming soon.

But I tried “Parchment” and “Crush”— they were both insanely pigmented and lasted AWHILE on my lips. While testing, I had to thoroughly clean my lips before applying the second one because it continued to show. So that was very impressive on first try. 

I did dock a star because the formula feels fairly drying, I know that’s typical in matte lippies but this felt sort of uncomfortable unless I used something much heavier and occlusive on my lips beforehand. 

All in all, I used these a lot during the past fall season and was super content with them! I would 100% go out of my way to purchase more colors when I’m done with these.","27 Jan 2024","Packing pigment & matte, long lasting","jdae"

The color stays put and doesn't rub off easily. The Crush color is a nice, soft beige look which is a nice, subtle color for when you want to look nice without dressing up your makeup.

Is the matte liquid lip trend back already? Well I have always loved a matte liquid lip but the problem with matte liquid lipstick is that it’s very drying on the lips. Come into play these ABH velvet lipstick. I love how weightless this formula feels on my lips. If applied correctly, it looks flawless on my lips. I didn’t find them drying on my lips as its a velvet finish and these never fully dry so they don’t crack your lips like other matte liquid lipsticks. However, here are my negatives for this product. Because of the velvet finish, they don’t dry completely and transfers everywhere so you need to reapply it throughout the day. The shade range is very limited and cater more towards fair skin type.","27 Jan 2024","Velvet lipstick but..","ushma30"

I am beyond impressed with this lipstick. The formula is so creamy and smooth. I love how it dries down matte. It's more of a hydrating matte because it doesn't get dry and crusty. I can apply it alone or add gloss to it, and it'll still last most of the day. I have two different shades that mix really well. One looks really good as a liner, and then I blend the lighter shade inside the liner outline. I can't believe how nourishing and moisturizing it feels. My lips never dry out from it. I can easily drink and lightly eat without it transferring. I've always loved ABH lip products, but this new line is a must-have. If you like matte nude lips, you've gotta try these. I definitely recommend them.","26 Jan 2024","My new favorite lipstick! (Crush & Parchment)","RachaelTam"

I was sent the shades Parchment & Crush. When I first received this item to do a review, I loved the packaging because it felt luxurious. It was weighted and designed beautifully. I really wanted to love the product because I absolutely love ABH’s eyeshadows. But unfortunately, based off of the longevity of the product, I would not recommend this to someone else. The formula feels soft and comfortable on the lips, but feels as though it’s moving around the entire time it’s on and the first chance it gets, it transfers and comes off completely. The texture reminds me of the Fenty Icon Velvet Liquid Lipstick which blurs fine lines in the lips. But overall, there are so many lipsticks that wear better for the same price, or even cheaper. On top of that, the color selection is not great. There’s only 2 shades that I could wear, out of the 6.

The second shade, Parchment is a darker brownish color that I thought I wouldn’t like at first but after applying it I really love it! The texture of this liquid lipstick is soft and reminds of a creamy mousse. I can’t say that I have ever used a lipstick with this texture, it’s very unique. I love how I can apply a thin layer for a light pop of color or build up a couple of layers for that full, rich pigment.

The positive: I like how easy it is to apply this lip product. I think it would look better with a lip pencil lining my lips first. It does stay on for a good bit of time. It didn't wipe off quickly or easily with just a wet wash cloth. 

The negative: The color choices are just too bland. The liquid is very thick and can get clumpy or messy. If you mess up at all, I find that you can not just easily wipe it off.

The texture is light and smooth giving me a beautiful matte finish. To my surprise it matched me more than I thought. I use Crush more because I can match it with different occasions and types of clothes. Parchment is beautiful and sexy but I need some makeup to wear with it.

While I might have chosen a better suited color for my skin tone I cannot deny that this liquid lipstick feels just like velvet upon application. It dries down quickly and leaves a matte finish. Dry lips need not apply! For if this is placed on a dry lip every single line will be enhanced. It feels light on the lip but is easily transferable. If this is your trusted brand and you're looking for a skin tone matte lippie look no further. I myself prefer a juicer lip.

My only complaint is that it comes over very easily. It’s great to wear on a night out and to compliment your makeup for the night just don’t drink anything while wearing it. I wish it would have stayed on a little better and I didn’t have to apply it as much throughout the night but overall I did receive multiple compliments on the color!!! Would I purchase on my own?

I have never been a lipstick person because I just don't think colours outside of chapstick look good on me. However, I was kind of taken back with how well the Anastasia Beverly Hills lip velt liquid lipstick applied for me. I have the peach amber which I kind of assumed to be on the lighter side but it was darker than I thought.. but since I was going to a tropical place for vacation, it kind of worked out for photos I planned on taking! I don't usually splurge on lipsticks but these are definitely much better than the drugstore ones I have been trying. If you like a bit of a bold look, pair this with a lip liner and you'll be ready to go!","22 Jan 2024","Perfect for the fall weather","KellyY017"

Usually they’re drying and look flaky on my already super dry lips. The ABH liquid lipstick is so nice though. I wouldn’t say it’s moisturizing, but it sure isn’t drying.

First the packaging is absolutely beautiful. It feels weighted in my hand and the application is easy. I received two colors and this Parchment color really wasn’t for me. It looks much more brown than peach and was just too harsh against my fair skin tone. It’s still a gorgeous color just not for me.  It feels more like a mouse than a typical matte lipstick which goes on liquid and then dries. It’s very pigmented and pretty. I personally did feel that it was a bit dry, but I'm admittedly in a lipgloss/liquid lipstick era right now so that could be a “me” thing.

The applicator is so soft and flexible, which is really nice when you’re used to those stiff applicators that are typically in a liquid lip product. l think they really nailed the name of this because it does truly feel like velvet. It’s super creamy. This isn’t a long lasting lipstick so keep that in mind.
The two colors I received, Crush and Parchment, are not anywhere close to the color representation shown. They are much darker and lean towards brown. When I first tried Parchment I thought I’d been transported back to the 90’s. 
Hopefully they come out with a bigger range of colors because I  would most definitely buy one in a different color- but only after testing the colors in store.","21 Jan 2024","So velvety but color is off","crystalmae83"

I usually shy away from liquid lipsticks especially in nude-y colors because it’s often a hit or miss. When it’s a miss it makes me look sick:( But I was pleasantly surprised by how these colors didn’t really wash me out and they don’t feel dry like other matte liquid lipsticks. For reference my shade is “Ginger” or Medium 2 by NARS (light medium with golden undertone), and when I’m not tanned during winter Crush is good for nude lips. I recommend pairing it up with a lip liner in Peach Amber (by Anastasia) or something close to that if you want a little definition on your lips. I also love the color when I mix Crush and Parchment - it’s like warm nude (shown in the photo). This will be my go-to when I get tanned and want nude lipstick! Parchment by itself is like 90’s light brown but make it 2024 vibe. I love them!

The shade Crush is such a pretty soft pinky nude and the color range for this line includes so many perfect everyday nude shades.","20 Jan 2024","","ak53"

It’s comfortable to wear, but since it doesn’t dry down completely, the wear time is not like a regular matte liquid lipstick- it will transfer. It gives a matte, almost blotted kind of finish.  It’s nice and I do like the formula, though it’s not my absolute favorite formula to wear, probably because of the transfer issue. The shade Parchment is described as a Peachy Brown. It pulls pretty dark and brown on me, it would be a nice fall shade. Overall a nice formula.","19 Jan 2024","Velvety","sarahjeangirl"

For my personal downsides, this smudges way too easily for my liking. But, to be fair, I do drink coffee a ton during the day and snack occasionally, so I might not be the best judge at smearing and fading! Which leads me to the next issue, the color fades weird on me.

I also tried the shade Crush and if Parchment was too light, Crush was a nightmare on my darker skintone. I tried it with lip liner, with a much lighter application, in the center of the lips with my other lipsticks...I just couldn't get into it. The feel of it is very silicone-y and with a lot of slip and felt like it was on top of my lips, not on them. The color sunk on my lip lines in a way I did not like. I only really liked the packaging since it was easy to find in my bag and the applicator, which felt decent. I would not buy another one of these, even if they branch off to non-nude shades. It's just not my type of lip product, it seems.","19 Jan 2024","Disappointments all around","EndlessWonder"

You might need a dark lip liner to keep it in check, but once you conquer that, it's a race against the clock because this lipstick dries faster than my witty comebacks. Nevertheless, it looks so good, it's practically my lips' red carpet moment.

Can we talk about the size of that lip package, though? It's bigger than my weekend plans, and I absolutely adore that about it. This lipstick is like a long-lasting relationship; I wore it to feast like a queen, and my lips were still slaying the game.

The color is rich and pigmented. If you love the original feel of lipstick on your lips then this is for you. I used to love wearing lipsticks but got annoyed of it not staying on so I stuck with liquid lipsticks. But this product keeps my lips hydrated while staying on all day. I recommended this product to a few of my friends and they loved. Pair this with a cute lip liner and slide that smooth applicator stick on those lips. It doesn’t have a sticky feel on the lips and there is no after taste which is a plus. You can mix parchment and crush together. I like to use crush for the center since it’s lighter and parchment overall since it’s darker. The colors are perfect for any event day or night. On top of that this product itself is so beautiful to look at and have it in your bag. The look of the product complements the actually product.

I was unsure at first about a matte lipstick that comes in a gloss container with an application but it's great thentear drop applicator allows for one swipe, all day wear, it moisturizes and prevents drying, cracking or flaking.

ABH is more smoothing compared to the romand ones and doesnt settle into my lip lines as much. im not a fan of the colours i received; Crush is too light and nude for my nc18-20 skin tone. it would not work on many people unless they like a pastel nude. parchment is better but a bit brown for my liking. this formula blurs out beautifully so i like to blot it for a soft look. because these are so moussey and soft, they actually mix with other formulas really well. i mixed Crush and a Sephora lipstories lipstick that was too purple for me and i liked the resulting colour a lot better.

It does that without caking or looking rough, so touch-ups are possible. The Parchment color was a better match for me. It was more peachy brown notes in that and the Crush color was a bit too pink for my skin tone. Overall I hope that you colors our introduced.

I received 2 colors, Parchment and Crush, which are two absolutely beautiful colors.  The first feeling about these lipsticks is that the lipstick design is so excellent, they are so beautiful and luxurious.  I also like the way they designed the tip of the liner, I can use the sharper tip to outline my lips and then use the flatter part to apply lipstick on my lips.  I love the soft and velvety texture of this liquid lipstick, it feels very light on the lips, the finish is super matte and the color is extremely beautiful.  It's a bit surprising because it lasts quite a long time compared to other regular liquid lipsticks.  Personally, I lean a little towards Parchment because it suits my skin better.  It also has a very pleasant fragrance.  In short, I really like them and will recommend them to my friends.","17 Jan 2024","These are gorgeous on my lips","Lynsaada"

The texture has a whipped quality to it that makes it very light weight and easy to apply. It doesn’t move around or slip even without a lipliner. It does not dry down completely matte and has a more creamy quality to it. The consistency reminds me of Dose of Colors which I also enjoy. It doesn’t leave my lips as dry as most other liquid lipsticks tend to. I have the shades Crush and Parchment. I am a light/medium warm olive skin tone, and parchment is a little too dark for me during the winter. Crush has a nice tone but reads a little more orange on my skin than I would like for a nude.

It applies very easily, like a mousse, and leaves a matte finish. Like most matte products, it can accentuate any dry spots on the lips, and it definitely is not moisturizing, but it’s not drying either. It really helps if the lips are well hydrated and free of flakes before putting any lipstick on anyway. I really like how weightless it feels (seriously like wearing nothing) and how long it lasts on my lips!

The first thing I noticed was how it glided smoothly on my lips. Usually, long-lasting lipsticks have a thick and dry formula. This was the complete opposite. 

One of the benefits of owning this product is that the size is not so big so it fits in any small pocket or purse for a night out, however, don't be fooled, little goes a long way with this product.

I received parchment and crush, pinky-brown-peachy nudes for my medium to tan skin tone. A couple of swipes will cover the whole lip. The product is a mousey texture, and it applies thick so a little goes a long way. 
It is a matte lipstick, so it doesn't feel very hydrating. I knocked off a star for that reason. They aren't as comfortable to wear without chapstick over or under, or a gloss topper.","17 Jan 2024","Pigmented and Mouse-like Texture","Lauren1477"

This lippie is freaking phenomenal! 

I was extremely skeptical about the formula upon opening the packaging and thought I got influenced by the all the incentivized reviews to buy another flop, BUT NOPE!

This is what I believe what the liquid lipstick game back in 2014 YT era should've been. This goes so perfect with a dark lip liner (or any liner really) for the ombre effect. The formula is very lightweight and this is one of those products where less is more ideal as I can see how layering this product can cause it to look cakey on the lips. It really did not dry down on my lips to where it felt like I had something on my lips which is an issue I have often with liquid lipsticks. This really has a blurring effect on the lips and doesn't settle into fine lines too much (although a little settling is going to happen with any product). 

The texture is very mousey for all my texture hating besties out there lol but this is going to be a product I am constantly going to be reaching for and will be buying the remaining colors. 

Will have to upload pictures later or make a second review just for the photos!","17 Jan 2024","IRL Instagram Lip Look","gabicuss"

I apply it in the morning and I don't feel the need to reapply it throughout the day. The lipstick application brush helps to draw the contour of the lips. Another positive point of the product is its mousse texture that stays in the mouth without drying it out.

There were little clumps that formed all around my lip line, these quickly spread to my hands, shirt, forehead and my lips looked like I smeared chocolate ice cream all over my mouth!

I applied it in the morning, went through my half day, and it's still there, unfazed. No need for constant touch-ups – a busy girl's dream.

A thin layer lies on the lips without emphasizing the relief, on the contrary, it smoothes it. 

The packaging is simple and incredibly aesthetic! 

The shade Crush is a beige-pink nude with a warm undertone. 
Perfectly combined with richer liners. 

The next shade Parchment is a rich color of milk chocolate. Unfortunately, it is too dark for me. I will try it in the summer for a more tanned tone. 

The characteristics are simply incredible! The lipstick is stay long, can withstand a light snack and non-greasy food. 

Visually blurs the lips, filling the folds. 

The aroma is sweet but not cloying. 

Definitely recommend to try!","14 Jan 2024","Nice!","hellil"

Crush is a nude shade that is great for daytime. Parchment is a darker shade which I’ve worn both night and day when I kept my other makeup minimal as I have fair skin. The formula honestly is like velvet on the lips. It feels very soft. It is definitely Matt but not drying the colors does a little bit but I found it to transfer everywhere like my coffee cup in spoon while eating. I do love that you really can use the product as a lip liner and lipstick all in one due to the shape of the applicator. However, this formula did not deliver on the blurring a fact that it promised, in fact, it showed more wrinkles that I’ve ever seen on my lips which I really didn’t like bottom line I personally as a woman in my early 40s would not purchase this product. I would consider giving it a shot if I were in my 20s or had a substantial amount of lip filler which left my lips very very smooth. Otherwise I’d look elsewhere for a matte lip color.","14 Jan 2024","Not my favorite formula","kristaaaah"

Okay I have been on this planet for several decades and have tried nearly every lip color brand in existence. I received this product as part of a free sample program. I have never had an experience like this Anastasia of Beverly hills liquid lip velvet lipstick. It features a light, airy texture with impressive longevity. It provides a beautiful soft velvet finish that's universally flattering. It leaves my lips supple unlike some matte products that are so drying. It is richly pigmented with gorgeous flattering color and not over scented / flavored. Truly decadent! I would recommend these lip colors to anyone who is a fan of velvet or matte looks, universally flattering shades without dryness.","14 Jan 2024","Divine","JBWE"

It's.... okay. The whole vibe of this lipstick feels very mid 2010s dated. It's that hype matte, crusty nude in different shades of brown. I didn't find the color particularly flattering, but will be using it at a grunge-themed costume party later this week. I know it's winter, but it made my lips look unreasonably patchy and dry. It didn't have much staying power, either... which can usually be a strong point for matte lipsticks. Worst of all, when it wore away, it left just the outline of the lipstick, leaving me with a truly 90s brown lipliner look. 

I just don't think this is worth it. The ""velvet"" component here just meant that the lipstick pilled up on your lips and looked altogether unflattering. Pass. 

Maybelline has a super stay matte liquid ink lipstick that blow this out of the water in every way. Do not waste your money on this.","14 Jan 2024","Mediocre","criticalreviews"

I do have fuller lips and can swipe both lips without having to apply more. It is very lightweight and feels smooth. It really needs time to set and isn’t transfer proof and will need to reapplied a few times. It’s so comfortable I sometimes forget I’m wearing it. The colors I got looked a bit pink and dark but when applied I actually liked the way they dried down. And if it helps at all I am light to medium skin toned.","14 Jan 2024","Love the colors","DizChickNina"

It's really soft and non drying. Crush is a soft color that I think would work for most anyone. That being said, I feel like it spreads a little too easily which left it a little too blurry for me. Also, as a 40-something, it settles into every tiny line and really made me see my lips in a whole new, not positive, way.

The packaging for this is probably one of my favorites. It’s not too big or small. I lose a lot of things in my bag so when I’m looking for a quick lipstick refresh I can just grab this from my purse without having to actually look for it (it’s distinct size and packaging helps me decipher it from the other 5 lip products I carry around with me)

Lip velvet is a great name for this product.  It looks and feels like soft velvet on my lips.  It's easy to apply and gives smooth full coverage.  It seems to be fairly resistant to smudging as there wasn't much product transfer when I blotted with a tissue after applying.  It has a pleasant vanilla/sugar fragrance that isn't overwhelming.   I don't love the color choice for me, as it doesn't look flattering to someone with pink undertones.  But I'll definitely try this in a different shade","12 Jan 2024","","princsss"

Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush is an exceptional product that stands out for its formula of matte tones without drying out the lips. Unlike other products I've tried, this lipstick offers a moisturizing sensation that lasts, providing comfort throughout the day.

One of the biggest benefits of owning this product is its precise applicator, which makes it easy to shape your lips. This detail is especially useful to achieve a defined contour and highlight the natural beauty of the lips. In addition, Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush provides a voluptuous lip effect, adding a touch of glamor to any look.

Personally, I find this product worth the money. The combination of matte shades, long-lasting hydration, and the precise applicator make it a must-have in my daily beauty routine. The moisturizing sensation is notable, which differentiates it from other similar products on the market.

If you are looking for a lipstick that offers both intense color and care for your lips, I would definitely recommend the Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush. Furthermore, due to its unique features, I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.

I love nude color lip products and this peachy brown shade looks good on my natural lip color. It definitely feels velvety and mousse like but dries down matte. It is full coverage in a way it’s very pigmented and you don’t need to use a lot. The applicator tip is nice to use for more precision application on the edges of our lips. It does rub off when you eat or drink so you will need to reapply.

I was really excited to try this because I love Anastasia products. My go to lipstick is their liquid lipstick so I was expecting the same long lasting qualities from this one. Upon applying it the first thing I noticed was the texture. It was very smooth but at the same time it dried out quickly so it was not as easy to apply as other lipsticks. I did like that it felt pretty weightless though. It didn’t feel drying even though it’s a super matte finish. If you want a matte lip this is it. The colors are very pretty, you just have to find the one that goes well with your skin tone. The biggest drawback is that it’s not transfer free. I’m used to my other Anastasia liquid lipstick to be long lasting and nontransferable. But this one rubs off easily. It looks like it’s completely dry on your lips and that it won’t fall off but it does transfer. That would be my biggest complaint. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone looking for a matte lipstick because the color and finish are beautiful.","12 Jan 2024","Great matte finish.","fumariel"

I wore this on a night out with my coworkers, and not once did my lips get dry or gross, which to me is a huge plus!
I do makeup in a professional setting for work at the salon, and I will be getting these in all the colors for my kit.
My picture is at the end of the night- still color on the lips, and not all over my face.

It also faded nicely throughout the day without getting flakey or weird. Plus I tried it as a blush, which looked super pretty, and that's a big win because I love multifunctional products. Overall, I think it great when my lips are properly moisturized, but as with all matte lip products I would avoid it on dryer/crustier days or stick with it as a blush.

If you like nude shades, this is a bold highly-pigmented nude shade with full coverage. The feel of it is hard to describe because it is so soft and smooth without any sticking or tackiness. It is a true matte finish and I love that the tip can act as a liner especially if you keep it for on the go. If you overline your lips I would still use a lip pliner because this mousse gives a blurred soft edge not a defined outline. The one con is while I would consider this a long-lasting lip coverage but it doesn't hold up well when eating or drinking.  I have truly loved the opportunity to try this new product that I received as part of a free sample program. Having said that, it will be purchased in the future.

I tried making it work with my go to brown liner, but it didn't help but so much. I tried this lipstick in the shade Parchment and loved the formula and color but I had the opposite feelings about Crush. This was super drying, very hard to blend with my liner and cracked within 30 minutes. I had to remove it soon after. This washed out my color and make me look like Dave Chappelle in that one skit on his show lol. I gave this so many chances but just couldn't get it to work.

I instantly fell in love with this shade, Parchment. While I did have to pair it with a deep brown lip liner, it is still such a beautiful shade on my deeply melanin blessed skin! I found this to be creamy, and it didn't dry down to the point that it was cracking or peeling. It felt super comfortable on my lips. I didn't notice any wear and tear or transfer until around hour 5, which is not bad at all. It doesn't have a chemical smell or taste like other liquid lipsticks I've tried.

I love that the applicator has an edge you can use to get a sharper lip line, but I don't usually use that side because I prefer to have a more blurred edge.

I was pleasantly surprised that this Matte lip velvet mousse was so smooth! Usually Matte is drying but this held the Matte effect and stayed velvety for hours! Even with eating and drinking the lip velvet lasted. 
It is thicker than others I have used which I liked also. It was very light weight. It also eliminated the need for lip liner because it was so precise however, it did bleed into fine lines a little and I may use lip liner anyway, but it certainly isn't necessary or that noticeable.
  The color was very nice. However it was a little more orange than the soft pink that it looks like in the photo which was very disappointing because it didn't go with my skin tone. However this won't be the case with everyone. I still love the color and it only has a slight orange hue. 
  This does transfer, it came off on my straw and when I kissed my baby. 
  Overall I would recommend this. Due to how long it lasts, you really don't need to re-apply often and I see it lasting for a very long time.","10 Jan 2024","Velvety, non-drying, super smooth.","Autumn0817"

I felt confident applying it, it did not bleed into my lip line or smear, and the color really lasted most of the day! I did do the drink test in the morning for coffee and in the evening at girls night - little to no product came off. My fiancée really loved this lipstick on me because of it staying on - so it passed the smooch test as well!

Although the matte velvet trend is not new or upcoming, the color and formula were good, and wore longer than I expected when applied. The color was also more natural than I had anticipated and blended nicely with my complexion and skin tone, which was an unexpected change considering how my skin changes as the weather conditions change in the region where I live.

I loved how soft and moisturizing it felt when I applied it, and the matte pigment with just one application lasted quite a few hours during which I had consumed a couple cups of coffee and a quick morning snack and even then I still didn’t need to reapply until after lunch and that it a definite pro in my book. However as much as I loved the palette of nude shades offered I really wish they would come out with colors that have both pigment & shimmer to them. I have never been one to like the look of matte lipstick on myself and so usually end up layering matte colors with a tinted shimmer gloss over them to achieve the look I prefer, unfortunately doing that does cause the pigment to come off a lot faster than wearing the pigment alone so hopefully they will expand the variety of colors they offer and include a shimmer in them in the future because I really loved everything about the product except for the plain matte look and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the look of a matte lip color as well as to anyone who needs the added moisture it provides. I received this product for free to sample in the color Crush and the color Parchment from Anastasia Beverly Hills & the BzzAgent sampling program in exchange for my honest review.","9 Jan 2024","I hope they add colors with shimmer….","JessG2102"

I would of loved more diverse shades to flex with especially for tan warm skin. Now, the Parchment shade is a nice shade out of this line up for tan skin to work with without having concealer lips. This shade is definitely a warm pumpkin color or /terracotta wit hint of brown  and the Peach Amber just 1 shade lighter to compare but its also a terracotta peachy.  Pure Hollywood ,Kiss and Peachy Nude....ALL Look the same on tan skin : Concealer lips !!  If im going to spend 24 bucks , I shouldnt have to always use a lip liner to make a color work!  Crush could possibly be the happy universal shade out of this bunch but still no diversity here. Where are the Reds, Berry's, True Mauves, but only giving us 2 pumpkin and concealer nudes working  only for fair skin lips ! ???  ABH can do better for a launch .  I dont get it.

I do make sure my lips are moisturized prior to wearing though. The only thing I didn’t like about the formula is that it’s not very long lasting. You definitely need to reapply throughout the day. I do really like the tapered end on the applicator. It allows you to line your lips and then use the flat part to fill in.

In my opinion, this is one of the best lip products from ABH so far. It is soft, creamy and applies butter on the lips.
It has a mousse formula and it feels like you have literally nothing on the lips.
Shade parchment is an especially beautiful warm shade that would suit most skin tones.

I normally have trouble finding a matte lipstick that I like because they are so drying and settle into my fine lines and throughout the day my lips just look worse and worse but not with these! The formula is so hydrating and smooth, it doesn't feel like I am wearing anything on my lips! Crush is the perfect daily nude color and Parchment is the perfect color for fall/winter.

Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick has solved a lip issue for me. I love the feel and look of a neutral matte lip color, but used to have to apply lip treatment and liners to keep my lips from being dry to the point of peeling and to keep the products in place when combined. This particular color is dreamy, it comes on not sooo stark and is muted. THe forumla is WONDRFUL, it not only is not drying, but almost conditioning. I LOVE THE COLOR and TEXTURE of the lipstick. The only drawback is that I found that I had to re-apply it (more than the other shade I tried) once or twice when wearing it for a full day. HOWEVER, it is easy to re-apply and basically fills right in without looking ""fresher"" than the rest of your makeup.

I took off a star for two reasons-- one being that while it doesn't instantly disappear when eating or drinking, it doesn't have the same longevity as the Kaleidos; and two because a lot of the shades they launched with are pretty similar.

I'm a sucker for peachy brown, terracotta lip and cheek shades, and Parchment is a beautiful option to have. The formula works well on lips and cheeks, and it's easy to work with whether you want a light, sheer wash of color or build up to a bolder, opaque look. A little goes a long way, so I would recommend using a light hand when applying.

Crush is a perfect nude shade for me (light-medium, neutral skin tone) and layers well with other lip products. I prefer more of a blotted lip look, and this liquid lipstick is able to achieve the my desired look with very little product - I simply dot a tiny amount on the center of my bottom lip, smoosh my lips together and blend to the edges with my fingers. I appreciate that I can get good color payoff even with a thin layer. The mousse like texture is lightweight and blends easily without spreading too much - it's easy to control where the color goes.

The formula is not sticky and leaves a velvet, matte finish. It dries down to an almost velvet stain. The color is pigmented and like most matte/velvet products, feels lightly powdery, but is not too caked if applying after a lip balm. It feels smooth and buttery although it still has the tendency to have patchy color if using on dry lips. Although the picture shows the pure color, I normally tend to wear a dark nude-brown liner before applying, then adding a bright pop of red or pink to the middle of my lips. I am a warm-neutral and these shades tend to look too cool for me although I can still find lots of ways to incorporate them. The formula is thick and as standard, it's rare to find an even one swipe applicator. I received crush and parchment for free to try and would likely purchase with a larger color tone range.","8 Jan 2024","suitable for light to medium tone ranges","sagicornempress"

The packaging is gorgeous, the product itself is a great matte formula. Def does not give that crusty matte look, it's a creamy matte finish. I personally prefer a lip color that wouldn't need reapplied during the day, and because of the creamy consistency of these you do need to reapply eventually. I have the color parchment and crush. Parchment is a beautiful Terra Cota color, perfect for fall. Crush is a deeper pinky nude. Both are gorgeous. I'd def repurchase, and use more for a date night than an all day color.","8 Jan 2024","","amonell"

I’m not one who likes bright bold lip color so this gloss type application is perfect. Your lips still get that little pop of color while being nourished and moisturized from the rough dry winter months. The matte velvet lip color wears weightless leaving your lips feel as if nothing is there. The colors are very buildable giving you the option to wear a more natural look to a bold color pop.

I’ve included pictures of how the colors look against my skin- I have a warm beige tone to my skin, and that seems to bring out the brown undertones in the shades. Crush looks really nice, a beautiful blend that looks natural. Parchment appears much deeper than the sample pictures, which looks rather modern and sophisticated. 
Unlike other matte finishes, the Anastasia velvet doesn’t get flaky, and blends nicely without extra smearing. It will transfer but reapplication is easy and doesn’t look uneven. The brush applies very evenly. “Velvet” is the perfect description for these lip colors, because it stays light-weight and smooth. It also isn’t a dry matte, so it doesn’t make my lips look dehydrated. 
Taking it off is really easy, I don’t need heavy makeup removers to remove the product.
Definitely excited to use these products on my next work trip, and also in my day-to-day to level up my outfits! Definitely recommend.","7 Jan 2024","Smooth, lasting, but not drying matte","Fates"

Reminded me of the 90's. I loved the buttery feel.  The coverage was great.  I have never tried a product that was matte but felt softening at the same time I just wanted to keep rubbing my lips together.  I did not like the applicator.  I didn't have any lip liners in the correct shades so I put this on without it.  I tried to line and fill my lips with it and it was not working the way I wanted.  So I think this definitely needs liner.  Problem fixed lol.  Shades were very matte.","7 Jan 2024","","Mmmkayy"

The formula is much improved from the old school liquid lipstick era but it wears a very long time and looks good! I love mixing the two colors using Parchment as a long wear liner and Crush to fill in the middle, and my lips dont look super dried out and crusty. It mixes well with gloss on top, tho I will say it does shorten the wear time. I love the lux look of the packaging and the doe foot applicator works so well to use the product to line and fill in the lips. Would definitely repurchase or even gift to a friend. They look beautiful on a vanity.","7 Jan 2024","Great formula and packaging!","boomeister"

ABH is a classy brand and the packaging for the lip velvets are classy and the liquid lipstick clicks into place so it doesn't get messy in your purse. It's matte but comfy. I got the shade Parchment, which a deeper taupey brown. Suits my skin tone more than the shade Crush. It reminds me of the lipsticks the Kardashians usually wear, you know? The nude-y type with a slight hint of color. I usually don't really like matte lipstick formulas but this one is comfy, I usually still top it with clear gloss but it is nice and you get a lot of product. The applicator is nice and allows you to define your Cupid's bow. The shade Crush is also pretty but kinda light for me and giving concealer lips. I am a medium skin tone with yellow undertones. So take that into account. Perhaps people with lighter skin tones could pull it off better.","6 Jan 2024","Shades Parchment and Crush","aaaaaaa22222"

The Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet offers a luxurious matte finish with a velvety texture. Its highly pigmented formula provides vibrant color payoff that lasts throughout the day. 

The application is smooth and precise, and the range of shades caters to various preferences. The velvety texture feels weightless on the lips during application, contributing to a comfortable wear experience. The matte finish delivers a sophisticated look, but it's advisable to exfoliate and moisturize lips beforehand to prevent any dryness. Overall, a solid choice for those who prioritize vibrant, long-lasting color with a matte finish.

Thank you Bzzagent and Anastasia Beverly Hills for the opportunity to get acquainted with such an amazing products. I would definitely recommend Lip Velvet and will be purchasing it in the future.","6 Jan 2024","Luxurious, Long-lasting, Pigmented","MarinLavrin"

I’ve been an avid consumer of Anastasia’s brow products, but didn’t know how the liquid lip would measure up. Fortunately for me, it packs quite a punch! I was impressed with the fullness of the shade, as it can be really hard to find a nude shade with a hint of tint to allow for a pop of color. I also thought the product itself held up well; it set pretty quickly, and I didn’t really feel like I needed to reapply for several hours. I also enjoyed the subtly of the shade. My one complaint is that the formula does feel on the thicker side, but running the wand inside of the neck of the tube plus exfoliating my lips ahead of time kept the secondary application much less messy.","6 Jan 2024","Great little gift for yourself!","AMPlified1013"

Upon first opening this liquid lipstick, I immediately knew that I loved the shade, because I thought it would look great with just about any look I decided to put together with makeup and fashion. The shade Crush, in my opinion, is an excellent option for a nude shade. With that being said, I was in awe over the formula once I applied it! It's amazingly lightweight to the point of feeling like a feather brushing onto your lips. Given that it's a matte formula, I was even more impressed by how buttery-smooth it applied and how creamy it was when rubbing my lips together to disperse evenly. I literally felt like I was applying a moisturizing lip treatment. That immediate satisfaction continued even after I had it on for a while. Matte lip formulas have come a long way and it's not as difficult to find a lip product in a matte finish that feels hydrating going on, but after some time has passed, I can usually still differentiate between a matte or a satin, for example. With the new Lip Velvet Liquid Lipsticks, I can't tell that it's a matte formula unless I look in the mirror. This liquid lipstick continues to lend that creamy moisture to the lips while feeling light as a feather! The texture feels super luxurious while providing a beautiful matte finish to the lips that blurs my fine lines and other little imperfections. This particular formula not only enhances my lips, but it also gives a fuller appearance. The lasting power was impressive as well, to say the least. Obviously, most of us would expect a matte formula to withstand several hours, but not one that feels like a lightweight, whipped formula that still manages to also feel rich and velvety smooth! Clearly I can't stop raving over the new Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick in the shade Crush thanks to its optimal quality and performance. This formula translates to...a matte, liquid lipstick at its best!!","6 Jan 2024","Perfection in a Nude Lip!","IzzyFrost2"

I will say this velvet lip shade (crush) is NOT the same as her liq lipstick in crush, it’s not as nude/pink.. it’s more of a brownish-mauve shade. On the lips it's not too noticeable, but in the right lighting, this one is definitely a tad darker. I'm not mad at it though lol. I tried getting good lighting for the pics to try to show the difference. Top lip is this new formula, bottom lip is their regular matte liquid lipstick.

To be able to easily outline your lip lines with the applicator without many flaws, is a breath of fresh air. I have recommended this lip product to my friends, family, and co workers.

The formula is so soft and I can see why it would be named lip velvet, it just glides on so sift and smooth. It isn't cakey but it is thicker. Great wear but not long wear. It looks matte and I love that. Matte look without the dry stiff feeling.

The texture is really soft and it isn't sticky at all. It does leave some residue on glasses when drinking and it does rub off some throughout the day - however, it has excellent staying power. After an 8-hour day, my lips were still fully colored. I also tested this product with a matching Anastasia Beverly Hills lip liner and it worked well together.

I tried crush and parchment. Crush is a bit lighter and is my favorite for daytime use, however, I do use parchment when I'm going out at night. Crush is a soft beige color and on my skin, it shows just the tiniest bit of orange.

The packaging is very nice and holds up well to travel. I also liked the shape of the wand. It made application easy. 

Overall, I really love this product and I will be purchasing again! This is one of my new favorites with the combination of the texture and the long-lasting application.","5 Jan 2024","New Favorite!","Lisa23471"

A little goes a long way, so be gentle with the application. The lipstick applicator is perfect to apply on the lips. The applicator is soft and has a pointed tip. The applicator also has a flat surface. I recommend this formula of all ages. It is very comfortable on the lips. I hope to see more colors released in this formula. I like how this formula feels soft on my lips and doesn’t dry them out. I have dry lips and this looked beautiful still. Parchment is a gorgeous cool tone brown. Crush is a beautiful beige color.

This lipstick is buttery smooth, easy to apply, and opaque in one coat. It’s matte without that dried down matte feel, if that’s something that bothers you. I got this in the shades Parchment and Crush. Crush is almost the color of my natural lips (but slightly warmer) and nice for a very minimal makeup look, and Parchment is pretty much the same color but a shade or two darker, which is lovely for a natural look but a little but more noticeable. Overall I think this is a great lipstick, but it does transfer onto cups and anything you put your lips on, so be aware of that.","5 Jan 2024","","lochnessica25"

I think it falls into the category of products where you either love it or hate it. I have tried lip products in the brown range but this one was not my favorite.

Also, I'm not sure why this is but this one felt quite drying compared to the Crush one. It gave my lips a cracked look after just a few minutes of this on. Strangely, it doesn't feel very pigmented and requires a lot to actually make a difference. If at the least the colour looked nice, I might wear it on occasion, however, this was not for me.

From the moment I applied it, I noticed how smoothly it glided on my lips, creating a velvety, matte finish that looked both chic and elegant.

One of the standout features of this product is its staying power. Even after a few hours, the color remained vibrant, and I didn't have to worry about frequent touch-ups. The shade Parchment is a beautiful, versatile color that complements various skin tones. It's become my go-to choice for both daytime and evening looks.

What truly sets this lip product apart is its comfortable wear. Unlike some matte lipsticks that can feel dry and heavy, the Lip Velvet felt lightweight and kept my lips feeling moisturized throughout the day. It didn't settle into fine lines or crack, which is a common concern with matte lip products.

Overall, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet, especially in the stunning shade Parchment. It combines long-lasting color, comfort, and a beautiful matte finish, making it a must-have addition to any makeup collection. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!","5 Jan 2024","Impressed with Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet","snapnpucker1"

Starting with the pros: The packaging is cute, the applicator gets exactly the amount of product you need and is pointed on top for lining the lips, and the colors are very pigmented. The cons though: given how soft and satiny it is on the lips, it's a little drying and emphasizes lines rather than blurs. It also doesn't dry down so it stays comfortable, but this makes it prone to smudging (I will say the color lasts a while though!)

Overall a decent lippie - the colors read/read a little darker on the skin than they look in the pictures, and I wish there were even more options! I used Parchment over the entire lip with Crush in the center and it was the perfect blend :)

The texture is creamy and velvety, and it applies smoothly with the cushioned wand. It has a matte finish that does not dry out my lips or accentuate any lines. It also has a blurring effect that makes my lips look plump and smooth. The color payoff is amazing, and it lasts for a long time without smudging or fading. The packaging is also very chic and classy, with a rose-gold cap and a clear tube that shows the shade. I think this is a great product for anyone who loves a matte lip mousse that is comfortable, pigmented, and flattering.

The formula glides on like a dream, all smooth and velvety – think mousse vibes, but for your lips. What I love is that matte finish without the annoying dryness you usually get with other matte lip goodies.

This lip velvet is like your trusty sidekick during meals and drinks, doesn’t budge an inch, keeping your look on point. And let’s talk about post-meal touch-ups – a quick swipe with a napkin, and you’re good to go. Even in a sweet, romantic moment, this lip velvet doesn’t play games – no smudges or lipstick marks left behind!

ABH didn’t forget about us with different skin tones; the color range is fire, including deep complexions. Shoutout to them for being all about inclusivity! The packaging is sleek and chic – perfect for throwing in your bag for any occasion. Long story short, ABH Lip Velvet brings the cool mix of innovation, practicality, and killer colors – I’m definitely building up my collection!","5 Jan 2024","ABH Does It Again!","ohthatsashley"

Give it a good minute or two to dry, and the color lasts for hours.","5 Jan 2024","Beautiful colors and nice applicator","vivaladoc"

Although nudes are not my choice for lip colors, the formula for Lip Velvet is like BUTTER! The pointed tip on the applicator helps with more precise application or to line the lip. This product is not drying to your skin, but is a pretty matte finish. The color is pigmented, no strange smell at all.
I would recommend this to someone looking for a matte nude lip color that is smooth and non-drying.","5 Jan 2024","Smooth and Non-Drying","StacySephora101"

This lipstick has quickly become my go-to for any occasion. 

First of all, the formula is incredibly smooth and creamy. It glides on effortlessly and feels so comfortable on the lips. I have tried many lipsticks in the past, but this one truly stands out in terms of comfort. 

The color payoff is also amazing. The shade ""Crush"" is a beautiful soft beige that suits my skin tone perfectly. It is highly pigmented and provides full coverage with just one swipe. I love how bold and vibrant it looks on my lips. 

What I appreciate the most about this lipstick is its long-lasting formula. It stays put for hours without fading or smudging. I can confidently wear it throughout the day without worrying about touch-ups. Even after eating or drinking, the color stays intact. 

The packaging is also sleek and elegant. The lipstick comes in a sturdy tube with the Anastasia Beverly Hills logo engraved on it. It feels luxurious and high-end, which adds to the overall experience of using the product. 

I must also mention the pleasant scent of the lipstick. It has a subtle vanilla fragrance that is not overpowering. It adds a nice touch to the application process and makes it even more enjoyable. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet lipstick to anyone who is looking for a high-quality and long-lasting lipstick. The smooth and creamy formula, intense color payoff, and beautiful packaging make it a must-have in any makeup collection.

I must also mention the pleasant scent of the lipstick. It has a subtle vanilla fragrance that is not overpowering. It adds a nice touch to the application process and makes it even more enjoyable. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet lipstick to anyone who is looking for a high-quality and long-lasting lipstick. The smooth and creamy formula, intense color payoff, and beautiful packaging make it a must-have in any makeup collection. I cannot wait to try more shades from this range","4 Jan 2024","Absolutely in Love","busybody131"
