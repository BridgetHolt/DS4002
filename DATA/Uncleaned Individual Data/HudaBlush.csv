This blush has a more pink color with a purple undertone, which I really like for my skin tone (I lean more cool-toned). The color is very fun and vibrant, but it's easily buildable, so you can adjust the intensity to what you like best. When you first apply it, you have to blend it out almost immediately; otherwise, it dries down rather quickly. The current viscosity of the product makes blending slightly more challenging for someone like me with dry skin. I prefer a thinner, more emollient texture with blushes, as they are easier to blend with my skin type. However, it still blends out pretty well. The product seems to have a slight blurring effect, which looks really nice and helps to give a flawless, airbrushed effect. I usually pair this with the Easy Bake Powder (Cherry Blossom Cake) like I did in this photo for an even more flawless look. The product also has a slight scent to it. So far, I've enjoyed all of the scents that Huda's products have, including this one. To me, it has a very sweet, cake-like smell. It definitely fits with the ube birthday theme.",12 d ago,So fun and vibrant!,stellareviews10

As someone who has a few similar colors in different brands/formulations (the closest I had before purchasing was the Em Cosmetics lilac serum blush), I had no business buying yet another blush in this color family, but I'm so glad I did. Immediately vibrant on the first application but still buildable, the color payoff is strong without being intimidating or overwhelming. I had an easy time blending it out on bare skin and over complexion products; in neither case was the application patchy. I haven't tested over a long period of time yet, but if the swatch on my hand is anything to go by, it sets pretty nicely without a lot of budge room after it dries down. If you/your skin can stand a scented makeup product (as with all Huda products, this is dripping in fragrance), I'd recommend picking it up - I think it's going to be my new staple liquid that I reach for when I'm in a pink mood! That said, while it is distinguishable enough from other similar blush shades in my collection, the color is not so radically different from other pinky/purpley blushes once it's on the skin; you don't need this if you already have a similar product.",14 d ago,My new pink/purple go-to blush,jag02010

They just blend and sit so much better on my GenX skin than powder blushes do...This goes straight into my 'top 3' blushes ever."" It was such a favorite, in fact, that I immediately purchased the ""Strawberry Cream"" version immediately. 

Huda's Blush Filter Soft Glow Liquid Blushes are described as “a lightweight liquid blush, with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls, for a soft-focus, high-impact glow”. Not only do they truly provide a soft-filter effect, the same colors also seem to magically work with just about every skin tone. ""Ube"" is no different. It becomes the perfect lilac-pink combo on my porcelain pink-undertoned skin. It also looks equally as gorgeous on a friend with much darker warm-toned skin. The blush has a wonderful mild cake-scent that isn't overpowering. It's a treat from start to flawless finish. Ube lasted all day with no caking, creasing, or settling.

Don't be afraid of the bright, shocking color. Just start slow - blend blend blend - and build coverage as needed. You won't regret taking the leap. It's another 10 out of 10!",20 d ago,Huda did it again!,shutterblog

As someone who loves rosy tones, this shade is perfection.

What makes this blush stand out is its beautiful filter-like, shimmery finish. It leaves a delicate, glittery glow that adds a touch of elegance to your look without being overpowering. It’s perfect for anyone who loves a feminine and radiant effect. The formula is so versatile that I can wear it even without foundation. In fact, as someone with pale skin, I rely on blushes to bring life to my complexion, and this one is perfect for everyday wear.

The texture and blendability are outstanding. Whether you prefer to use your fingers, a sponge, or a brush, this blush blends seamlessly, leaving a smooth, natural finish. It’s lightweight, breathable, and buildable, making it ideal for any occasion. Plus, it eliminates the need for highlighter because of its luminous shimmer.

One of my favorite things about this blush is the delicious scent—it’s subtle yet so inviting that I almost want to eat it! The fragrance adds to the luxurious experience of using Huda’s products, making it a joy to apply every time.

The shade Ube Cream is versatile and pairs beautifully with just about any look. If you’re into pinkish, pastel, or lavender tones, this shade is a must-have. It has that perfect balance of soft color and radiance, making it wearable for any outfit or mood. I also own Huda’s Cotton Candy blush, which I loved, but Ube Cream is truly next-level.

As soon as I started to blend it, the color went away and I was disappointed. The next time I tried it,  i just smudged it on my cheeks and it was too much. But when I added 10 dots on each cheek, the color looked absolutely gorgeous on my skin, the pigment is absolutely stunning! 

The packaging is correct when it mentions it is a buildable formula. It has a peanut shaped applicator, and melts on your skin. 

Don't get me started on the smell of the blush. ""Ube Cream"" smells of a delicious pastry, such as a luscious cake. It smells so good, I want to eat it!

One of the standout features of the Huda Beauty Blush Filter is its ultra-creamy texture. It applies effortlessly onto my skin and has a smooth, almost airbrushed finish, which is great for creating a natural, lit-from-within glow. The formula also has a touch of luminosity, making it perfect for those who prefer a dewy finish over a matte one. Even on more textured or dry skin, it doesn’t settle into fine lines or pores, which is a huge plus. The blush is highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way, but it’s easy to build up the intensity to your liking. The product blends beautifully, offering a flush of color with a radiant sheen, without being overly sparkly or glittery. In terms of wear, the Huda Beauty Blush Filter lasts a good amount of time, staying vibrant throughout the day without fading or patchiness. It's versatile, working well both on its own or layered with other cheek products. The only con will be if a person prefers a matte look to looking dewy on their cheeks.",6 Nov 2024,,kelseyburns

One of my favorite things about this blush is how lightweight it feels on the skin – it’s almost like wearing nothing at all! It has a silky, soft-focus finish that gives my cheeks a beautifully filtered effect without the need for any actual filters. It’s blendable and buildable, so whether I’m going for a natural flush or a more dramatic look, this blush does it all with ease. Just three dots on each cheek and a quick blend with my fingers, and I’m ready to go!

The micro-pearls in the formula add a subtle, high-impact glow that never looks overdone – it’s the perfect balance between dewy and radiant. Plus, the candy scent is an extra sweet touch.

This liquid blush gives me the perfect balance of color and glow, leaving my cheeks with a soft-focus, airbrushed finish—no filter needed.

The formula is lightweight and blends so easily into my skin. I love how the micro-pearls in it add just the right amount of glow without being too shiny. The blush is buildable, so I can layer it for a more intense pop of color or keep it soft for a natural flush.

What really stood out to me is the innovative peanut-shaped doe-foot applicator—it makes applying the blush a breeze. I simply dot it on my cheeks and blend it out with my fingers for a seamless, multidimensional finish. The candy scent is also a fun touch that makes the whole experience feel a bit more indulgent.

I appreciate that the blush comes in five shades that work across all skin tones, so finding the perfect one for me was easy. Whether I’m going for a subtle glow or something bolder, Blush Filter gives me the flexibility I need.

Overall, I really like this blush. It’s easy to use, has amazing staying power, and leaves my skin looking flawless. If you want a liquid blush that blends effortlessly and gives you that ‘airblushed’ finish, I highly recommend giving it a try!",5 Nov 2024,Creamy!,nikitabustydill

This blush line promises a silky finish that blends easily onto the skin, creating a natural flush that can be built up for more intensity.

Here’s a breakdown of the highlights:

	•	Texture & Formula: The blush has a finely milled, lightweight formula, which gives a smooth, filter-like finish. It’s a powder blush, but it doesn’t feel chalky or overly dry. The formula glides on seamlessly and doesn’t sit on top of the skin, blending effortlessly with other makeup products.
	•	Color Range: Huda offers a versatile color range that complements various skin tones, from light to deep complexions. The shades are thoughtfully curated, with options that lean warm, cool, and neutral, so most people can find a shade that suits them.
	•	Pigmentation & Wear: This blush is moderately pigmented, so you can go for a light touch or build it up for a bolder look without it appearing patchy. It has great staying power, typically lasting most of the day without fading, even on combination or oily skin.
	•	Packaging: True to Huda Beauty’s aesthetics, the packaging feels sleek and sturdy. It’s compact enough for travel, and the transparent lid makes it easy to find the right shade in your makeup bag.

Overall, the Huda Beauty Blush Filter is a high-quality, dependable choice if you’re after a soft-focus blush with excellent blendability and long wear. Its range and finish make it a worthy addition to any makeup routine.",31 Oct 2024,My favorite,viktoriia1994

First off, the packaging is absolutely adorable. The innovative peanut-shaped doe-foot applicator makes it so easy to apply just the right amount of product. Just a few dots on each cheek, and you're good to go! 

Now, let's talk about the formula. It’s lightweight and feels like a dream on the skin. The pigments are buildable, which is amazing because you can start with a subtle hint of color and build it up for a more intense look. And trust me, it blends like a dream. I usually just use my fingertips to blend it out, and it melts into my skin effortlessly, leaving a beautiful, seamless finish.

The shade Cotton Candy is a gorgeous baby pink that gives my cheeks the perfect pop of color. It's super flattering and gives that soft-focus, high-impact glow that we all crave. The finely milled micro-pearls in the formula add a touch of radiance without being over the top. Plus, who can resist the yummy candy scent? It’s a delightful little bonus that makes the application process even more enjoyable.

What I love most about this blush is its versatility. Whether I'm going for a no-makeup makeup look or a full glam, this blush delivers every time. It has major staying power, so I don't have to worry about it fading throughout the day. And did I mention it's free of all those nasty ingredients like parabens and sulfates? It's also cruelty-free, which is a huge plus in my book.

A little HUDA hack I’ve been loving is combining shades for an ombre effect. I pair Cotton Candy with Strawberry Cream for a fresh, multidimensional look. Start with three dots of Cotton Candy on the apples of your cheeks, then add two dots of Strawberry Cream higher up and blend together. It’s so easy and looks stunning!

In all honesty I had very low expectations prior to trying this. Liquid blushes in general are typically not my favorite formulas; I usually prefer a cream or powder but I'm always game for trying a new product. I'm actually pleasantly surprised because I genuinely think that this is a good formula, definitely better than I had anticipated.

I have a light skin tone but I went out on a limb and chose the darkest color, Black Cherry, because I've been trying to add a couple of blushes with purplish undertones to my collection.  I was a little hesitant since I didn't know how blendable the formula would be and I wasn't sure if the shade would be too dark for me but after using it a couple of times and with different application methods I've been impressed by how easy it is to use and how nice it looks on the cheeks.

It has a slightly thick gel-like consistency and I've had no difficulty applying it both under and over powder and it hasn't smudged or lifted my base makeup either way. I can either apply it to the back of my hand and pick it up from there with a brush or sponge or I can use the doefoot applicator and apply the product directly to my cheeks and blend it out- - either method works fine.  The formula allows just enough play time for it to be adequately blended before drying down so it doesn't end up looking patchy or splotchy. Even though this is the darkest shade I can make it work for my skin tone but because it is quite pigmented initially I think it will be beautiful on darker skin tones.

Another thing to note is that it seems to have a slight staining quality to it so it lasts quite a long time. I've even lightly applied it to my lips and it provides a wash of color that looks absolutely beautiful. I definitely see myself getting more use out of this than I had initially anticipated and I think that it's a fairly intuitive formula that a lot of people will be able to us",7 Jun 2024,Beautiful Formula,CookieGirl1

It applies so well and blends nicely. I love the filtered look. It has a nice buildable pigment. I got the color strawberry cream and it gives a nice sunkissed glow.

Things I don’t like: I slightly feel the formula on when it dries down, it’s way too glittery. It’s less luminous and more sparkly.  The camera has a hard time picking up on how glittery this is.

It actually looks the exact color I flush when I am hot or I blush. As far as it being “radiant”, I would call that sparkly, borderline glittery. I wish it was not quite so sparkly. But, because it blends nicely, it isn’t so bad if I am sparing or just set it with powder. The package is the absolute cutest thing, it looks like candy.",13 Jun 2024,"Too sparkly, but blends well",thejunglerose

It also blends every easily with your fingers or a brush, allowing a little versatility with application. They give a very natural finish, leaning slightly dewy, but don’t slip around the skin, even on my oily skin type. They do have a bit of sparkle to them, which I don’t love but it doesn’t appear glittery on the cheeks, I just think they could do without.

Another beautiful product by Huda Beauty. I chose Black Cherry, which is quite pigmented. It's beautiful. It's easy to blend and work with. If you apply too much you can follow up with concealer or foundation to tone it down. I find I reach for this more than the blush stick (I still love the blush stick) lately. 

The only cons for me are the lack of parabens and the glitter. It's more glittery than luminous. Let's hope it lasts as long as my other (non-""clean"") makeup and doesn't grow bacteria without those needed parabens.

Besides the beautiful color, the formula is also incredibly easy to work with. I can dab this on with my fingers or a brush in less than 10 seconds and it leaves a really nice subtle glow on the cheeks. I find that the black Cherry shade is also really long lasting, it kinda acts like a tint, but one that is really easy to blend. This formula is also pretty blurring on my skin.

I got the strawberry cream color and compared it to haus labs glassy rosette. They were very similar, in color. Huda was slight more cool toned I think. Strawberry cream is a beautiful color, just didn't work for me.",1 Aug 2024,"Just okay, color was beautiful",LicyPiecey

I’ll admit that the PR videos had me hooked, and I NEEDED to try it. I received this product in exchange for my honest review, and I am so happy the product lived up to the influencer hype I saw online. It is soft and blurring, comfy on the skin, and it is super buildable. I’ve been having a berry blush moment, but I have fair/light skin, and it can be hard to find nice berry blushes that aren’t too overpowering. The nature of this blush makes it easy to sheer out and build up as needed, which helps make a bolder blush shade super wearable for us pale folks. I am a layering girl, so I can’t speak to how it lasts on it’s own, but layered with a powdered blush on top, the longevity is impressive. I’ve already ordered it in Strawberry and Watermelon to add to the collection because the finish and buildable nature of the blush are perfection! I just wish the shade range was a little larger and more varied. Fingers crossed for more shades in the future.",21 Oct 2024,,hannnnahb

This liquid blush delivers a vibrant, fresh pop of color that instantly brightens up the complexion. The “Watermelon Pop” shade is a gorgeous pinkish-red hue that looks natural and flattering on the skin.

The formula is lightweight, buildable, and blends seamlessly, allowing for both a subtle tint or a more dramatic, flushed look. I love how easy it is to apply; just a few dabs on the cheeks and it melts into the skin without leaving any patchiness. The finish is radiant but not overly dewy, providing a healthy glow without feeling greasy.

The lasting power is also impressive, staying put throughout the day without fading significantly. It’s perfect for those who prefer a liquid blush that can be layered over foundation or even worn on bare skin for a fresh, no-makeup look.

I did two small dots on each check and that gave plenty of pigment. It blended out easily. I used a makeup brush but you could probably just use your fingers and be good to go.

A pop of color with a filtered finish! Blush Filter is a lightweight liquid blush with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls for a soft-focus, high-impact glow. 

Huda is obsessed with achieving a filtered finish without the filter. Blush Filter's formula has plenty of playtime as its blendable pigments effortlessly melt into the skin with major staying power for an 'airblushed' finish.

It's available in five beautiful shades that work across all skin tones, Blush Filter also has a yummy candy scent to complement the sweet shade names. Their innovative peanut-shaped doe-foot makes application super easy. Just apply three dots of blush on your cheeks and blend with your fingers for a multi-dimensional, pigmented finish.

Shades
Cotton Candy~ Baby Pink
Peach Sorbet~ Peachy Tangerine
Strawberry Cream~ Dusty Rose
Watermelon Pop~ Warm Brick
Black Cherry~ Burnt Berry

I'm absolutely in love with this gorgeous blush. It's super easy-to-use and gives a soft focus filtered finish. It's lightweight and melts effortlessly into the skin. It's buildable and blendable. You can even blend colors for a beautiful ombre effect. You can create a lovely, soft look or make it super blown out by building more. This is one blush I definitely recommend. I need them all now!

The liquid consistency makes it super easy to apply with fingers or a brush, and it lasts all day without fading. I also appreciate the wide range of shades, which cater to different skin tones beautifully. Plus, a little goes a long way, so the product will last you for ages!

This shade is a soft peachy-orange that flatters a range of skin tones and brings a healthy warmth to the cheeks. Here’s everything you need to know:

✨ Formula & Texture
Mousse-like, lightweight texture: It feels super airy on the skin, almost like nothing’s there.
Buildable coverage: Start light for a subtle hint of color, or layer it up for a bolder pop—perfect for both natural and glam looks.
Seamless blending: It melts beautifully into both bare skin and over foundation, so no streaks or patchiness in sight.
💖 Finish
Soft matte with a natural radiance: It gives the skin a healthy glow without being overly dewy or shimmery—ideal if you love a natural finish.
No caking or heavy feeling: Even with multiple layers, it feels breathable and looks smooth on the skin. Oily skin? No problem—it stays put without sliding off.
⏳ Wear Time
Long-lasting: It holds up throughout the day, even in warmer weather, keeping that flushed-from-within look intact. No need for constant touch-ups.
🎨 Shade: Peach Sorbet
This peachy-orange tone adds the perfect warmth without looking too bright or overwhelming, making it versatile for both daytime and evening makeup. It complements bronzed looks beautifully but also works great on fairer skin tones for a fresh, youthful vibe.
🌸 Pro Tip
For a naturally lifted effect, apply it higher on the cheekbones and blend toward the temples! Add a touch to your nose for that trendy sun-kissed look.

Verdict
The Huda Beauty Blush Filter in Peach Sorbet is a winner if you love a blush that feels light, looks natural, and blends effortlessly. Whether you’re going for an everyday flush or a full-glam moment, this one has you covered.

Would I recommend it?
Absolutely! If you want that effortless, peachy glow that lasts all day, this is a must-try.

It’s pigmented yet buildable, so I can go for a barely-there look or layer it up for more drama. Plus, it lasts really well throughout the day, keeping that pop of color without needing touch-ups.

They just blend and sit so much better on my GenX skin than powder blushes do. So after seeing several reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on Huda Beauty's liquid blush. I chose the color ""Cotton Candy"" because I have very light, porcelain skin with pink undertones and the description (baby pink) sounded right up my alley. I was not disappointed. This goes straight into my ""top 3"" blushes ever.

The blush is described as ""a lightweight liquid blush, with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls, for a soft-focus, high-impact glow"". I couldn't have written a better product description myself. It seemed to glide on the skin and make it look lit from within once it was blended and buffed. In the wrist-swatch I've included you can see how well it blended and worked with my skintone, and that is taking into consideration the large amount I used for photographs. With liquid blushes, less is always more so I could get by using 1/3 of the product that I used for swatching. It was nearly impossible to photograph but up close when the light hit the blended-in blush just right it would almost sparkle. Not a ""Twilight"" / ""I've just been to a glitter convention"" type of sparkle, but more of a youthful luminance. Once blended, the ""filter"" was in full effect as my fine lines just seemed to disappear. It lasted all day with no caking or settling. I didn't even mind the candy scent.

Not only would I give the product a 10 out of 10, now I want it in Strawberry Cream (dusty rose) for winter and Peach Sorbet (peachy tangerine) for spring/summer as well!",25 Oct 2024,"My favorite new-try in a long, long time!",shutterblog

This blush has quickly become a staple in my routine, especially since I’ve been discovering the ease and versatility of liquid blushes. They're effortless to apply, blend seamlessly, and save so much time compared to powders.

The shade Cotton Candy is a beautifully light, pastel pink that has such a soft, feminine appeal. It sits perfectly within the pastel pink family, giving just the right amount of color without overpowering the look. I find that just three small dabs of this blush are all I need to create a subtle, natural flush. You can adjust the intensity easily by adding more product if desired, but a little goes a long way.

What sets this blush apart for me is the hint of shimmer it contains. It’s almost like a built-in highlighter, giving a gentle, luminous glow that catches the light in the most flattering way. When I wear it, my skin has this beautiful, dewy radiance that’s hard to achieve with other blushes alone. The formula blends seamlessly with the rest of my makeup, creating a soft, glowing finish that feels effortless.

And then there’s the scent! As the name suggests, it’s got a light, delicious fragrance that actually smells like cotton candy. It’s so inviting and adds a delightful touch to the experience of using this product.

Overall, Huda Beauty nailed it with this blush. If you’re into pastel pinks or looking for a blush that feels feminine and fresh, I can’t recommend Cotton Candy enough. It’s perfect for those who appreciate a delicate, subtle touch with a bit of glow. Give it a try—you won’t need much to create that perfect blush effect!",28 Oct 2024,for Patel shade lover's,rachel7leo
