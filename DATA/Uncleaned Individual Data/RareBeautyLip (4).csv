It truly does protect the lips from dryness! I did a lot of research before purchasing a product like this and chose this one initially because the reviews said the packaging doesn't leak. I can confirm: it doesn't! Pretty ~rare~ for lip glosses not to leak. I also really like the Nearly Apricot color, which leans more pink than orange. I'll probably pick up the rose one for summer.

Also, when dipping and pulling out the wand, the product amount comes perfectly, unlike some lip glosses that absorb too much or too little of the product. For the quantity of the product, I wish there was more of it in the bottle. 

Wear test - I like that the product isn’t too sticky and the colour is visible. Both by itself or layered on top of a lip stick, it works well. This product works throughout the year for multiple occasions. I also like that the Berry shade would look good a variety of skin tones. On the downside, it doesn’t last long so I noticed I would have to re-apply throughout the day. 

Overall, this is a great lip gloss for that subtle but put together look. I have continued to re-purchase this and have gifted to others who also highly recommend.","MissEhs","31 Dec 2024"

It's strange because it feels so good, but if it comes off it doesn't leave any hydration behind. That's why I docked it a star. I have repurchased this because it's beautiful.

I wore this so often I created an empty more quickly than any other product and my lips didn't feel or look right without it to me- this product is a part of me now! My lips are some of the crustiest, most dry things on the planet and this balm is sufficient in hydrating them and adding some lovely color to them.
In complete seriousness and realness.
I was and am always scared of the uncomfortability of makeup and how it makes me look and feel, but this is such an effortless and chic addition to my day to day looks whether I'm adding it to my work outfit or going out with friends. I've gotten so many compliments about looking refreshed and healthy with more nude shades (for me) like muave and compliments about looking pretty and colorful with the berry, which beautifully compliments highlighters and fun eye looks.
It's my personal holy grail product for lips and I adore it and the word favorite is overused, because I cannot emphasize enough how comfortable and beautiful this balm is!","RBSkinandMakeup","23 Jun 2024"

Probably lasts 2-3 hours after application so reapplying is necessary.  At $20, it’s very reasonably priced and I will definitely buy more and keep them in my beach bag, sling bag and backpack.

I'm a tomboy who loves a more natural makeup look. My lips are also on the dryer side so I need all the hydration help I can get. When I saw that this was a more neutral color, I figured I'd give it a shot and I'm glad I did! 

First, it looks so natural - ""a my lips but better"" kind of look. It definitely gives a nice color with a bit of shine. For a lip gloss it's fairly well-lasting and not sticky but does need to be applied once every few hours to maintain the look. It's also fairly hydrating I which I think is important as we head into the colder months.

Overall, I'd recommend this because it is natural looking, long wearing for a lip gloss and is hydrating. I'm planning to now get it in other colors!","Livvygirl97","14 Oct 2023"

For the first 5 minutes of wear, there is a slight tingle that feels warm on the lips but eventually goes away. Its the second Rare Beauty lip product I've tried that didn't mention the tingling effect. The colour is fairly opaque for a lip balm and it stays glossy for a an hour as long as you don't drink/eat. The Nearly Neutral shade is more of a medium warm brown, not really a neutral pink. I likely won't repurchase once I finish but I don't dislike this product.

I usually use mostly drugstore products, but like to splurge as a treat once in awhile. I tried looking for a dupe and figured it couldn’t be much better than my nyx butter gloss in praline/Madeline. Upon first application I loved it and it feels lighter and more buttery/silky compared to nyx…BUT what made this something I will always continue to get is- 
#1- I have very sensitive/reactive lips and this was comfortable to wear, no irritation
#2- how it wears/fades gracefully
With butter gloss I’m usually left with some gloopy edges remaining (I don’t use much either) once the center faded. This product made my lips look exactly how I’ve always wanted them to, fades in a way that I don’t have to worry about it. And with just this one product too, no liner or lip color needed! My lips looked fuller and not matte, but also not way too glossy (looks great for no makeup days or nights out) I can say I’m fully obsessed with this (specifically in nearly neutral) and will purchase it as long as they make it :)","Masyn812","5 Apr 2023"

The formula is kind of similar to Vaseline and is more of a lip gloss/lip stick. Taste and smell wise, there isn't much of a smell or flavor. 

Reason for stars been deducted: 
The colour does not last and at the same time transfers. I usually avoid wearing this lip gloss as it stains. It stains my water bottles and any cup that I drink out of, the stain does go away. However, I accidentally got some of the lip balm on a white cotton t-shirt. I have tried vinegar, dish soap, baking soda, oxy-clean, oxygen bleach, tide pen, and chlorine bleach and nothing. 

Also, I did mention that the formula is similar to Vaseline. I dislike wearing this lip gloss if I'm talking for a long time as it leaves that Vaseline feeling on my teeth, it's kind of similar to how Vaseline is used in beauty pagents so that you keep smiling.","DianyT","1 Aug 2022"

This is my favourite so far. Tints are hard for me because I have dry lips, and the colour stains dry skin vs. moisturized skin differently. Tinted solid balms are fine, but nothing special. THIS... this is special. The closest product to it is the original Fenty Gloss Bomb, but this is somehow both less sticky and tacky, and also less emolient??? Like, it doesn't feel as thick, and yet is also doesn't move around as much. Anyways, if you, like me, want a little hint of colour that you can apply without a mirror, like nourishing products, like the Fenty Gloss Bomb, and want the lowest possible maintenance... this is for you!","sarahmg","27 Jul 2022"

For 0.1 oz, it is a bit pricy(though still costs less than a lot of lip products at Sephora), especially since it doesn’t last very long on my lips; I just adore the feeling and happily reapply. It really does sink into your lips and soften them, but if you are applying primarily for the color and gloss it may disappoint you. The sensorial feeling of them I am just obsessed with. It is “cushiony” soft like a balm- not really slippery or oily, like a gloss. I have all 5 shades now and have even repurchased several of them, the past. The shape of the component/applicator is misleadingly large and also makes it impossible to get the last little bit out of the tube, but I still enjoy the doe foot anyway.

I do believe that the gummy texture that comes from lip gloss depends on how much you apply though. Anyways, the color did fade after probably a few hours so I did have to reapply, but after a few days of using this lip gloss, I saw that my lips were getting extremely chapped and I never understood why. I later realized that this lip gloss was the heart of that problem; it did lots of damage to the outer-layer of my lips. This disappointed me, but the tints on these lip glosses are perfect; not too much not too little. I would not recommend this for daily use as it might also damage your lips, but a few times a week would be good too if you want to avoid damage.","paulagjoka","16 May 2022"

It still has a glossy component to it but adds that extra lip balm feel too.

I have a fair complexion, dark brown hair, cool undertones, and the Nearly Berry shade gives perfect MLBB vibes in a gloss form. Like, PERFECT shade (for me). I am a natural/matte lip kind of gal usually and get easily annoyed by gloopy glosses or too much shine -- this gloss is NOT gloopy, and the shine is sort of natural looking instead of high gloss. It is smooth, soft, and pleasant to apply. I won't go as far as to say ""not sticky"" because I have yet to experience such a thing and don't think that really exists in a gloss. On days when I need to take a break from my usual matte lip color and need more moisture or a glossier look, I LOVE this comfy, smooth gloss.

Rare Beauty has turned me into a lipgloss girl.This gloss/balm is so moisturising, it feels pillowy on the lips and while it doesn't stay all day (no lipgloss does) it's a joy to reapply. It will not dry out your lips, I swear. My lips are always dry. I don't even need lip balm underneath! Will repurchase over and over. The colour payoff is sheer but noticeable.","ValeCristina","7 Apr 2022"

i’m very pale and hesitant to using any colored lip products (i usually wear clear or slightly tinted glosses/lip oils since my lips have barely any color to them) but i ordered the shade “nearly neutral” and it is PERFECT, even on my pale lips. this gloss has the texture and hydration of a lip balm, and shines like a gloss, but it does not slip around or feel sticky like most glosses do. 
i always have had to layer a lip balm underneath any lip product i use because my lips tend to dry out and become cracked with nearly every lip product (even lip oils!), and this is the only gloss i do not have to do that with.

I really like the subtlety of this balm, it’s not super pigmented so it really does give a nice natural color to the lips. I also love the texture of this too, it’s not too thick and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky at all. My lips definitely feel soft whenever I use this. The only thing that’s kind of a bummer is that it literally only lasts like 15 min but that’s like with almost any lip gloss/balm so it is what it is I guess. Overall, I think any of these colors would be a good choice for someone who wants a little bit of color while still giving your lips some hydration.","xolaurenxo94","8 Oct 2021"

They sell them in all these great colours but it comes out clear on the lips (well mine at least) so it’s pretty pointless to pick a colour if it’s not gonna show.

There are absolutely worse glosses out there, it stays on nicely and the color is lovely and I'm so glad other people enjoy it, but I feel severely misled by the hype.

But since this also acts like a lip balm more so than a lip gloss i found this super easy to implement into a daily routine. It does a great job at enhancing your features without coming off as “too much”. SO WORTH your money!! Ps.

Great for a hint of shine and slight colour.

This does dry fast enough, no streaks, not sticky, I can go on forever. If you want punchy high pigment you should go for her liquid lipstick.
I bought Nearly Apricot blush as well to match.
Just stunning on my normal to dry skin.
Winter here in Montreal and this product used with a brush, fingers or whatever you desire is pretty easy.

I’m a huge fan of “your lips but better” type glosses but this doesn’t do it for me for a few reasons- 1. color payoff could be better. One layer doesn’t make much of a difference for me and I find I still have to use a lip liner or put on 2-3 coats. 2. Texture is ok- it’s creamy, but nothing revolutionary. 3. Longevity is meh. I was just wearing this around the house and found without eating and drinking it was gone within 20-30 min.

It really makes my lips look plump and juicy. The texture is incredible, I’ve never experienced a lipgloss like this. The texture is so dreamy it makes me want to rub my lips together all the time, haha. I feel like because of it’s texture it clings (in a good way) to my lips and lasts a really long time. It looks like when the product warms up on the lips it gets even more shiny! There is minimal colour payoff, but thats what I look for in a gloss. If I need colour, I’ll pair it with a lipstick or something. There is no scent which is fantastic to those who are sensitive to it.

I love the feeling of the formula, I also love reapplying and the colour is definitely their and sometimes subtle depending on how many coats of gloss you use. It’s hydrating as well. I do find sometimes that the formula can get a bit sticky after a while of wearing it but I just reapply and it’s all good!

no difference to my lips. At first I was like what the! Because I got this as a free sample and quickly realized this was a gloss and not a lipstick. There was so little pigment I was stunned. As everyone claims, it is not sticky but extremely glossy, which is why I chose to rate this product so high.

The shade Nearly Berry is very dark in the tube but applies sheer on my lips and complemented my skin tone.

I can’t believe how beautiful these glosses are! They aren’t sticky whatsoever, feel sooo smooth and creamy on the lips, have a beautiful colour playoff, and are pretty long lasting! My lips feel super moisturized whenever I wear these and I love that all of the colours are pretty universal and natural looking! Don’t get me wrong I love a sparkly gloss as much as the next girl but sometimes you just want a super natural glossy lip look and with these that’s exactly what you’re going to get! In my opinion these glosses are even better than the Fenty gloss bomb’s! I find with the Fenty glosses they can be a little sticky and I can taste the gloss all the time which is pretty off putting but with these you can’t taste a thing and there’s zero stickiness. After trying this shade I immediately went and bought nearly neutral and nearly apricot and I’ll probably end up picking up the other shades as well since they are stunning!

For comparison, I have a NYX butter gloss in Praline that I purchased for 8$ CDN which I personally found was a lot better than this gloss. I posted a picture comparing the two (NYX is on the left, RB on the right). For such a large disparity in the price, I didn't find this lipgloss great.","Sabeebs","19 Jan 2021"

This is EXACTLY what I look for in a gloss! The texture is a medium viscosity—not as thin as the Tower28 gloss and not as thick as the Glossier gloss. It is luxuriously balmy, smooth, shiny, and self leveling. The gloss feels nourishing and moisturizing, similar to the Laneige lip mask. I have fair skin with cool/pink undertones and the Nearly Mauve shade makes my natural lip color slightly darker and richer. It really achieves the “my lips but better + a flair” type of look. If you love sheer, slightly buildable gloss shades, you will love this formula. Also, the shine, color, and possibly the formula itself did give my lips a plumper appearance which is always a bonus! The product lasts as long as a gloss typically does—you can wear it for an hour or two before you need to retouch but it does fade beautifully. I am highly impressed!","KacieAnne","18 Jan 2021"

This formula is reminiscent of the Roen Kiss My Liquid Lip Balm (no longer sold on Sephora, unfortunately) and Tower 28 glosses. If those two had a baby, this is their pride and joy. It's not as pigmented as Roen and the texture is not as slippy as Tower 28 on the lips. It's balmy when you rub your lips together (so yummy), not as thin as a traditional stick balm and not as thick as a gloss like Tower 28. It's not the most long lasting, but it fades nicely and leaves my lips so hydrated even after a couple hours (I tend to have dry lips). I tried a sample of this while purchasing the melting blushes.

The shade that spoke to me the most was ""Nearly Berry"" which looks really nice of my fair skin. This Glossy Lip Balm is like anything I have tried before. I was impressed by the texture of the product -  it feels exactly as a cushion that hugs your lips and offers them long lasting hydration and a bit of shine. The color is buildable, discreet (don't except any crazy shades of berry), but I don't recommend overdoing it, because this product is so hydrating that you don't need to build up layers. It offers enough color and shine, again without that stickiness. I was quite impressed that it stayed well under my mask too.

I’m also giving it away on my ig glou beauty along with other items in this collection. It doesn’t feel heavy at all, which I find is the case with a lot of other lip glosses (like tower28). It’s not super long lasting, nor is is super pigmented, so it kind of reminds me of a lip oil. However I like it so much more than other lip oils (kosas, ilia, lilah b) because it lasts longer and has a better feel overall. I haven’t found a gloss formula I like as much as chanel until now. I’m really happy they didn’t toss in any silicones into this formula because I was starting to associate rare beauty with super slippery formulas which I’m not always down for.

The wand applicator threw me off as well because it has a tapered point all around but it was very easy to apply to the lips while the lips were closed. It took literally 5 seconds to apply the balm flawlessly. It does feel like your typical balm without any sticky feeling.
