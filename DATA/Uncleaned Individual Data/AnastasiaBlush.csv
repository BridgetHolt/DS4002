The colour and texture are so nice…but the pigment is not there. It literally disappears on my skin when I’m trying to blend it. It’s not buildable.

It does not blend, and the brush with it does not extend out to blend. It’s useless. The color is pretty, but if it doesn’t blend well, what’s the point?

It’s so convenient that it comes in a stick form with a brush. The two big misses for me: the brush isn’t great and the pigment is not there! No matter how much I put on, it just disappears.

It gives a nice shimmer, so it can double as a highlighter. However, the brush isn't great—it tends to separate the blush and leave a patchy look. I prefer using my fingers for a more even application. It gets the job done but isn't my favorite.","17 May 2024","","dvnlse"

I was very exited to buy it because I saw some YouTube reviews describing the Latte shade as the perfect shade to go with any look and it looked so beautiful in all the videos that I saw that I wanted to buy it, specifically to minimize the amount of makeup that I take with me when traveling. Well, that's not going to be possible because although I love the format of this product, the packaging, the shade, the initial pigmentation, and the blendability, it simply lacks staying power. I have several shades of the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blushes and those have amazing staying power. They are trickier to blend, but once you learn to work with them they are awesome for combo skin throughout the entire day. I also own several Tarte Maneater Blush & Glow Cheek Plumps and the Charlotte Tilbury
Beauty Highlighter Wand in Pinkgasm and both of them are easy to work with and have excellent staying power. Sadly my expirience with this ABH blush stick has not been good and I would not recommend buying it if staying power is important for you.","8 May 2023","Beautiful, but very disappointing","ynlt"

I purchased this after reading reviews that had it as one of the top rated stick blushes. I swear reviews are all paid for or incentivized so it's hard to find a genuinely well-rated product, and sadly, this is not it. This formula is not blendable at all. Like at allll. I'm a fan of highlighting and contouring with cream make-up and wanted to throw a non-powder blush in the mix but trying to blend this will tear up your other make-up and look blotchy.

It comes in a stick form with a brush, so I just put a short line on the top of both of my cheekbones and a small line vertically on my nose and blend it. It blends really nicely and has a nice, pale pink which is very natural. I love this blush for days when I'm in a bit of a rush or want a very petal, pretty pink look.","17 Jan 2023","","rose7mari"

Not this - a little goes a long way.  I also love the included brush - not sure why so many are saying they don't like the brush because it's too stiff.  I find it perfect, also so great when travelling as you don't need to pack a separate blush brush.  You can blend with your hands too but what I love about the brush is you don't need to get your hands messy.  I normally have a light-medium skin tone, but tanned in the summer, and I was worried the pink dahlia colour might be too intense but it is just perfect after it's blended in.  Gives a really nice natural glow.  Love everything about this product.","20 Jul 2022","Best stick/cream blush I have tried","ains19"

It is comfortable on the skin and feels like you are not even wearing blush.  Use your fingers or the handy brush attached to the end of the stick to disperse.  You can layer for more intensity.  I have to admit cream blush is a favorite formula for me if the color and quality are high and this lovely stick meets the bill.  I really enjoyed using this whether I was just wearing a little tinted moisturizer or over full foundation.   The only improvement I would recomend is to make the attached brush bristles a bit longer.  This does not affect the blush itself but would make application a little smoother.    The current bristles are short and firm but work ok if you don't want to use your fingers or another blush brush.   Overall though typically brushes are not attached to cream sticks so I prefer the versatility of having this accessory versus none.  Another positive is that there was no streaking or patchiness whatsoever.  It lasts longer on top of foundation and powder but that is typical for blush.  You can even smear a little on the lips and apply lip gloss on top for a natural lip look.  The pretty gold casing is very cute too.  I would definitely purchase this again as I am always on the lookout for great cream blushes.","4 Oct 2021","Finally a great cream blush!","beautybyme"

My brush on the tip and then stipple it on my cheeks and it takes so very little used to color my cheeks. So advice is to apply it this way instead of swiping stick on cheek and then blending. Saves a lot of the product.","8 Sep 2021","","JennyW47"

I was actually so pleasantly surprised on how the color turned out on my skin, which leads me to believe the latte color and all the available shades will look great on many different skin tones! The blender brush side is nice and soft and really buffs and blends out the color nicely and evenly. I am used to liquid blush but really liked how the cream spread and the brush can precisely put the color where you want which is sometimes a problem I run into with liquid blush and using my finger as an applicator. Will be using this for a while to come and excited it’s a new color for me than what I’m used to. Definitely a great fall shade!","7 Sep 2021","Latte works on so many skin tones!","laurmac15"

I got the shade Peachy Keen as I love peach toned blushes and it’s sooo pretty!!! It’s easy to use and easily blends into my skin so I think all kinds of people would be able to enjoy it. It’s creamy yet the color payoff and lasting power is still really good. I would repurchase these a million times over!

I live in high humidity so don’t expect cream products to survive long in the summer - but this did ok. It’s a really pretty color and I love the packaging!","30 Aug 2021","","sehines"

The color is subtle but buildable.  I got the color Peachy Keen and it gives the perfect sun kissed glow.  It is definitely a bonus to have the brush on the bottom end of the stick, it’s stiff but the bristles are soft so it makes it very easy to blend. Works well with both liquid and power foundations.  Definitely recommend if you are looking for something beautiful, easy and multi purpose.   *I received this item to try for free but the opinion is my own.","30 Aug 2021","beautiful, easy and multi purpose","gab6784"

One side of the stick blush is the blush itself and the brush. It is extremely easy to apply and very long lasting. It is quite pigmented so you'll have to blend it in.

When I applied this on my check bones, I already had foundation on. The application was a bit, I wouldn’t say difficult, but different from my original makeup routine with blush because I had to dab the product instead of swiping it on my check bones. When I swiped it, I saw it took off some of my foundation which was irritating. This is why I proceeded to dab this cream blush instead of swiping it. This is very pigmented so you have to blend it in! It took a little bit of work to blend in but the result was beautiful. I also applied this on my nose bridge to give the effect that I had been tanning on the beach. It looked beautiful! I wore this on a hot 80 degree weather, but it did not look messy or greasy for about 4 hours. After than, I had to apply powder on where I applied the product. I do have oily/combo skin, so this is bound to happen with any cream product. It also comes with a brush side to blend the blush in, which made me love this product more. I overall recommend this product. I gave it four stars because it did take my foundation off where I applied it by swiping.","27 Aug 2021","Beautiful blush","kbeauty13"

There is no scent to the stick. I also love that it has a convenient little brush on the end that you can use to blend it out. I took this as my only blush on a recent vacation and it was perfect for travel because it was small and easy to pack and there was no mess at all, and no melting.  I’m excited to try other colors in this blush stick as well. Great product and I highly recommended it! I included a picture of how this blush swatches and what it looks like blended in so you can get an idea of how the actual color looks on the skin.

I received the shade peachy keen. The packages claimed that it is an illuminating cream blush with flexible coverage and flawless finish. I have been a huge fan of trying new cream blushes lately. The packaging is stunning. The container that holds the blush is double sided with one end containing the cream  blush and one end containing a very small dense packed brush. Both ends have covers to protect each side which I love. This is very travel friendly bc it is a perfect size to through in your purse. The blush color is beautiful. It is a nice bright peachy color that would look good on so many skin tones. 
I absolutely love this blush!! I use it all the time. It is so easy to apply and blend into the skin. I don’t care for the brush that came in the other end and that’s why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. But this blush is buildable. You can leave it shear or build it it up to get a much more color payoff. It does have a beautiful illuminating sheen to it as well. It is such an easy to blend formula that is forgiving bc it is so easy to use a brush to move the  product around on your cheeks.

The color Carmel Peach is a beautiful color. I love how it looks for a natural makeup look. One thing I don’t like is the brush.the brush is so stiff it doesn’t blend the product well. I prefer to blend it with a sponge or my ELF 105 stippling brush. It really not good at all, the brush needs to less dense to have more flexibility. I would rather for it to maybe not have a brush and be a little cheaper without it.","25 Aug 2021","lovely but hate the brush","Sallymontana"

I love the packaging and the design of the blush was really neat. I love that there’s a brush attached. I received the color Latte and to be honest I was a bit nervous that this color wouldn’t work for me. Latte is described as “rosy brown” and I feared it might be too dark for my skin tone. For reference, I have beige skin (usually under the “light” shades) and am neutral toned. Surprisingly, I thought the blush worked well on my skin! It didn’t look too dark or noticeable that I was wearing makeup. However, I don’t think this color would work with someone with fairer skin or someone who is cool toned and fair. As for application, there was some trial and error involved. I found it easiest to dab on with the stick, then blend using my fingers. You can also use the brush it comes with, and I imagine a beauty blender would also work well with this. I can see this product being great for someone with dry skin who tries to avoid powder products. Overall, I’m giving it four stars because while I think it’s a cool product, I definitely prefer regular old powder blush. It’s just a lot simpler for me to apply and I feel the overall look works better for me. Would I recommend this product to a friend? Sure! If that person is interested in trying a stick blush, I think this is a great place to start.","25 Aug 2021","","nhperry"

I’ve been wanting to try a cream blush. The blush is very buildable but I did notice that it disturbed my foundation a bit when trying to blend it using the brush end and it lost almost all pigment. The brush on the other end of the stick is useless. Using your pingers to blend it is the way to go. Looks so natural on the skin.

I think  this color goes well on all skin tones. The formula is creamy and dries down a bit but not completely matte. It does come with a brush at the other end which I don’t use, I prefer to apply with my finger tips and blend it out.

It's pretty pigmented so you don't need to apply a lot, but it's smooth and creamy in texture and blends out really nicely. Pink Dahlia is a good color for me, I tend to go heavier on blush but this gives more of a natural glow that I really like.

I actually had the problem of overblending it the first few times I used it because I wasn't expecting it to blend out so easily, but I've gotten the hang of it and it's really quick to blend out with fingers or the brush on the other side of the stick. I usually use my fingers for cream products, but the brush works surprisingly well.

I have combination skin and tend to get dewy over the course of the day, but this lasts pretty well and doesn't appear to fade much or at all. Overall, I'm pleased with this and enjoy using it.","25 Aug 2021","I like this a lot","LauraEJ"

This is my first stick blush and my first ABH product experience so very exciting. I got this in the shade soft rose which is a beautiful deep rose color that works beautifully on my light skin tone. The packaging is beautiful as well! It comes in a stick compact with one end holding the blush and the other end holding a soft bristle brush to blend out the product on the go. The brush works great and I usually use the brush tho I also like using my fingers instead. Its a buildable blush so u can adjust how deep u want u color to be. My only caveat is it doesn't seem to stay on long, I find I nee do reapply a few 2-3 hrs so deff need a good setting spray or setting powder to try to get it to last better but luckily it's easy to carry around also in case. Although it doesn't last as long I still love it and is definitely a new staple for me.","24 Aug 2021","Beautiful color!","alhu"

The color was intense going on but blended out to look more natural and glowy. It did take some time to blend out with the brush included. Staying power was much better when I applied a powder blush on top. I would recommend only if you are looking for the convenience of having a brush built in to your cream blush. Otherwise, I feel that other comparable cream blushes stay on longer without the extra step of adding powder blush.","24 Aug 2021","","amberangeline"

The built in brush worked great in buffing out the product after swiping it onto cheeks. The brush even pops out for easy cleaning. Although I only have the Milk Makeup blush stick to compare it to, I far prefer this one for it’s softer and more blendable formula - I found the latter too hard and “stiff.” Only taking one star off my review because I still prefer powder blush formulas but I’ll still definitely get a lot of use out of this product - thanks ABH!!","23 Aug 2021","Blendable stick blush","natmanso09"

Instead of a nice soft peach as it is described as, it was a very bright coral/orange. I personally don’t like shades like that when I’m as pale as I am right now. Maybe if I had a nice tan going this would work? As for the attached brush on the opposite end, it is nice and soft but due to how small it is… it doesn’t blend very well (instead it creates a small stripe of blush on your face). I would rather use my fingers, a sponge, or a bigger brush. I’m going to be returning this product and instead buy latte (everyone’s favorite shade). I’m really hoping that works as I love the creamy and dewy formula. As for longevity, I didn’t wear this long enough to attest to that… I blended it out and hated the color so much I washed it off.","23 Aug 2021","not a good shade for us pale people","dezzyalexandra"

The packaging stuck me when I opened the box.  The luxe-looking gold tube is beautiful.  The provided brush on the end is so soft and it applies the blush like a dream.  When I applied the product, I noticed that it melted right in to the skin with very minimal effort.  I’ve also applied with my fingers and got the same beautiful results.  It gave me that lit-from-within look.  The color complimented my summer skin tone beautifully.  This blush was put on at about 7:00am and it was still flawless by 9:00pm!

I received Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Blush in soft rose to test for Influenster to provide my honest review. This shade is perfect for my skin tone. The application was easy to blend and looks like a natural glow to my skin. If I use foundation or not, this stick provides fresh looking skin. Proof is in the pictures.
I generally will use a sponge to apply; however, for this application used my fingers and I was thrilled about how easy the stick smoothed into my skin. I have been using a powder but will move to the stick because of the way it feels on my skin, and also there was no powder to clean off of the counter.","22 Aug 2021","Ultra-lightweight Color","Sweeton"

I have the blush in latte with is a very pretty rose brown shade. The blush goes on so smooth and blends beautifully. Latte is a beautiful, neutral tone and is perfect for daily use or if you’re keeping your look neutral. I would 100 recommend this color to everyone. I feel like it’s one of those shades that is flattering for a wide range of skin tones.  Great packaging in a beautiful rose gold. The compact size makes it easy to throw into your makeup bag or purse when you’re on the go. 

My only complaint is it definitely didn’t last in the GA heat and humidity. I was pretty disappointed when I got home after running some errands and you couldn’t see it at all anymore. That being said, once the humidity and head calm down, I will definitely be wearing this blush daily! I’m also going to get Dahlia to have for when I want a little more color.","13 Aug 2021","","kentqueen52"

We're all familiar with the phrase ""you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"". With this blush it was truly a case of "" you don't know what you've been missing until it arrives!"". I received this through Influenster, and I am over the moon with it. When it comes to HG products blush isn't the first staple that comes to my mind, but Anastasia absolutely nailed this! The packaging is what would expect from a higher end brand (substantial and well conceived). It contains the product on one side and a dense but soft brush on the opposing end. I didn't think would use the brush, but the applicator was so well designed that it works with the product beautifully. I received the color Peach Carmel, initially in the tube wasn't sure if the color would compliment my NC20-30 skin but it ended up being a gorgeous match! The color payoff is perfect and requires just a touch for a natural look, but is easily buildable. I love products that can multitask, and this performs well as a creamy eyeshadow for a 'no makeup' makeup look. Buy it!","12 Aug 2021","Gorgeous and a great value!","EPOM"

I goes on fairly smooth and not patchy. It comes with a built-in brush at the bottom,  which has stiff bristles. The stiffess seems to help move product around, but it is a bit small for my taste. My only real qualm is that the color is too cool for me - shows up  bit grey and ashy on my brown skin.

However when this went on my skin, it is the perfect neutral pink but like in the most dusty pink (in the best way possible). It is not a super bright pink, it is not a fuchsia obviously lol. it is not a soft pink even, it is a natural flush for my skin tone. I really love it! Now for the price point of $32? I don’t know if it’s necessarily worth that. I would say 25 to 28 would be good. The little brush that comes with it is kinda hard to clean bc it’s so dense.

The color is just what i was looking for, it compliments my skin tone very much. I use my fingers to apply it on my cheeks and it gives a natural soft and flawless finish every time that I cannot be happier with! But let me tell you while i loved the package I didn’t like the brush it is kinda harsh and the product would blend way better using your hand especially if you have dry or combination skin like me.","4 Aug 2021","Soft and flawless look","bonnie898"

At the beginning i thought it would get patchy all over my cheek because it doesn't budge when i try to blend with the brush that coming with it.
After i try to blend it with my fingers it was well blended and absorb well to my cheek creating that natural look. 
I personally like this product since it is cruelty free and vegan. I also like the finishing look that giving natural-no-make-up make up looks. It feels light and match my skin tone. I put on my nose as well and it shows up naturally giving a fresh look. Love it!","4 Aug 2021","Replacing my current powdered blush","keneys"

I was not expecting much since stuck/cream blushes tend to look garish on me and don’t blend in. This stick has changed my mind! The color peachy keen fits perfectly with my fair and freckled skin. The cream blends smoothly whether you use the included brush or your fingers. Best bonus? Non irritating or pore clogging! Sensitive and acne prone are not a good combination for new products, but not one breakout or red patch from this makeup. If this runs out, which might take a while since we need so little to pop, I will be at the make up counter for more! Love it.","4 Aug 2021","Love, Love, Love!","amandamcewen041"

I am absolutely in love with this blush! I don't typically like makeup in a stick format but this did not disappoint. It glided on really smooth and creamy! I love that it didn't disturb my foundation  underneath like many others do, even while blending it out. It blends and even builds like a dream with a regular blush brush or even a beauty blender because I wasn’t a fan of the brush on the other end. The the color (Pink Dahlia) is absolutely stunning.

I typically wear this on bare skin with no foundation; however I have worn it over tinted moisturizer and it blended in beautifully. I have used this on its own and by setting it with translucent powder. Setting it does make it last a lot longer, but even on its own it lasts at least 6 hours.

I took off the cap, love the color (Peachy Keen) and wanted to try it on right away! I swiped a bit on each cheek and started to blend with my finger when…the other side of the stick opened to reveal a brush! A built-in brush! It’s genius!!! The blush stick itself is creamy and easily blended in to my primer/powder base for a seamless cheekbone glow. The brush has short bristles, which are ideal for blending, and works really well to spread the product exactly where you want it to go! I’m thrilled with this product and will definitely be looking for more shades that work with my skin tone!!","3 Aug 2021","It’s got a BUILT-IN BRUSH!!!","meredith53"

It was easy to apply because it is creamy and has the right amount of pigmentation. It blended well into my skin and lasted nicely throughout the day. I knocked off one star because I do not like the brush on the other end. I found out that it is detachable, which is nice, but it’s still too dense and causes the blush to get patchy. I prefer to use a different brush to apply this product. Otherwise, I am really enjoying this blush! Very pretty and I love the rose gold packaging too.","3 Aug 2021","","BWPD28"

I received peachy keen and the shade is a lovely soft peachy coral color. This is a double sided stick with blush on one side and a removable brush on the other. The component is a shiny gold tube but it is light weight and a bit cheaper feeling than I'd like.
The blush is creamy, not powdery, and applies well directly to the face or with a brush. It blends easily and leaves a soft sheen behind. When worn on its own, it faded very quickly, like before I left the house quickly. Since, I have set it with a powder blush of a similar shade and it lasts significantly longer than powder or cream alone. Overall, I am happy with this blush and I will definitely get a lot of use out of it.","3 Aug 2021","Good but not the best out there","kluxe"

I have liked using cream blushes in the past - but always in flat palette/pot packaging, which I inevitably use my finger to apply (not so sanitary & also takes a careful touch to avoid looking clown-ish). Alternatively, the powder blushes that I love necessitate tossing a separate brush in my makeup bag (which I will often forget). I love that I can swirl this creamy blush on the apples of my cheeks and then use the brush end to spread it and smooth out edge lines. The peachy color is perfect for summer and I will absolutely purchase!","3 Aug 2021","perfect peachy glow","msbritt"

Here’s why... Number 1 I’m not an expert make up artist  so I can appreciate the precision application of this product. I always seem to loose a little blush under where I want to apply it. With this product there is no such problem it’s precision application baby!!! Now number 2 I’m 40 years and my skin even with a serious skincare routine just doesn’t seem to hold the moisture it once did. So that leads me to really appreciate the cream blush as it blends super smooth and easy into my skin. To blend I used the provided brush at the other end and I thought it did a great job. The color was very neutral and pretty for my skin tone. I would definitely get this product again!!! I can’t wait to try more colors!!!

I have not had the best experiences with blush over the years. I have a light to medium skin with a lot of natural redness. Most blushes often look like clown make up on me. This blush looks gorgeous on and is truly a game changer in the world of blushes!

First of all, the shade peachy keen is perfect for any skin tone. It has a warm, almost clear peach look to it. It goes on so easily and melts right onto my skin. The brush enclosed within the blush is amazing! A total game changer. This product looks amazing in the tube, and goes on flawlessly. I found that this shade gave me just the right look of sun kissed peach, without looking to pink or clowned like. this is definitely a blush I would purchase in the future.

It’s super easy to apply, I tapped it on top of my foundation to avoid smudging it, then used the brush to blend it further by gently tapping as well. I typically go for a peachy or light pink colored blush, but I really liked the latte color, as it gave me a bronze, sun kissed glow. I used setting powder over top of it to make it less dark/ a bit more subtle. It also works great as a lip tint! I made sure my lips were exfoliated, then used my finger to blend it on my lips and finished it off with a clear gloss.","31 Jul 2021","","cclement5"

Living in the South, I prefer to use cream, especially in the summer time. I received the shade peach caramel and I would describe it as a peachy, brown shade. The formula is so smooth and I only need to glide it once for the pigment to show up. The color lasted about 6 hours and it definitely held up in very humid conditions.

I have found very few blush products that I find both natural looking and easy to control. I have fair to light skin with golden undertones and love the latte color, although it's brown toned enough on me to use as a contour as well as a blush. I use cream and stick blush in the summer especially since I typically go with a more sheer foundation. I wore this with both my sheer, natural-finish liquid foundation and my regular, medium coverage, matte-finish liquid, with and without printer, and I am pleased with how this performs in every instance.

What I love:
Creamy texture glides on easily (no pulling) without being smeary and thin
Color is richly pigmented but also blends easily without losing pigment
Easily buildable
No noticeable fragrance
Natural finish (no glitter/shimmer, naturally radiant but not shiny)
Versatile color
The blending brush is so convenient and it is detachable!

My need for control is so supremely satisfied with this product!

I have acne prone mature (early 40s) skin, and this did not bother my skin at all in any way, either.","28 Jul 2021","Easy to control, natural finish!","randomeight"

This cream blush is very beautiful and natural looking on me. It applies lighter than it looks in the tube. It is creamy and blendable. It is buildable (up to a point). It is easy and convenient to apply. Just dab or draw the blush stick on your cheeks. It can also be used as a lip tint, but this particular color washes me out for that purpose. The packaging is very nice and luxurious. There is a brush at the other side, which is nice, although unnecessary. You can also blend it with fingers or a sponge.

I love the idea of a stick blush with blending brush all in one. Unfortunately, this product just doesn’t deliver. All three stars are for the blush itself which is a very deep rose shade.

I usually go for powder blush but was excited to give this a try. This new Anastasia stick cream blush comes with a built-in brush which is fabulous! It’s as soft as everyone says it is, and makes it easy to blend the cream without messing up any makeup you have on underneath. The blush itself is very buildable which I love. The texture is very lightweight but, I do think it might be too heavy for me if I build it up a lot, given that it’s summer in South Florida at the moment. It’s fine if I use a small amount however, and the finish is lovely and natural looking. I’ll probably stick to powder blush during the height of summer but will definitely check out the other shades for other times of the year.","28 Jul 2021","Lovely cream blush!","sarahrob2248"

I love that’s it all in one, the cream blush on one end and the brush to blend it on the other. I don’t need to carry and extra brush around which is great! The stick color I got is peachy keen and it works perfectly for my tan summer skin, but I know it’ll suit my winter complexion as well. It goes on smoothly and the brush helps to blend it perfectly into my cheekbones. I hate the over powered pink cheek look, but this color makes for just a sunny rosy cheek look! The brush bristles are soft and blend well. Overall super happy with this blush and brush duo combo in a compact little stick!","27 Jul 2021","Blush and brush in a stick!","Funebone"

Pigmentation is meh, but I also haven’t tried building it due the fact that it didn’t sit well with tinted moisturizer I’ve tried with it and became oily throughout day. The product blended very well and I LOVE the brush built in at opposite end. I will need to try product with a standard foundation later to decide if the product didn’t like tinted moisturizer or it’s my skin type (combo) that the blush didn’t like it. 

Side note: I tried using as an eyeshadow to create a more monotone look, but it creased with eyelid primer used. I did add a few layers as I wanted to build up color, so it might just be the reason it creased. 

It can also be used as a lip color, but I have not tried that method of application to leave an honest review.

The blush product itself is creamy out of the tube and blends into a powdery texture. It is easy to apply and long-wearing, even under a mask in the summer!

That being said, I had some things I loved about this blush and some things I was not impressed with. My favorite thing about this blush was the color and I like that it was buildable. What I didn’t like about this blush is the brush that comes built into the blush applicator is super rough on my skin and I didn’t feel like it helped blend out the product at all. I always had to use my own brush to blend it out. The other thing I didn’t like about it was that it didn’t blend out very easily and it didn’t have the creamy texture that it claims to have (in my opinion). It felt a little on the dry side. I really wanted to love this product but it’s not something I would buy again.","27 Jul 2021","Hit and a miss","linzwebb2"

I am overwhelmingly in love with this stick cream blush. At first glance, the product packaging is amazingly beautiful. The quality of the attached brush at the end is incredibly soft and works great to evenly blend the color into my skin. At first I was nervous the color choice might be too bold, but when applied it gives my naturally porcelain skin a warn sun kissed color that looks natural and dewey. I am incredibly happy with the blush and look forward to purchasing other shades to complement different looks.","27 Jul 2021","Beautiful packaging for amazing product!","2BoyPeloMom"

The color perfectly enhanced my cheekbones with out being obvious that I had anything on.

My first impression of the packaging was wow, this gorgeous! The actual product packaging did not feel cheep. I first applied the cream blush by dabbing a few circles near the corner of my eye and side of my cheek and I used the dual end brush to blend it out but I noticed that the product began to fade and lose its color. I reapplied more product and tried it with a damp beauty blender. I did not really feel like the beauty blender was the best applicator for this particular product either. Lastly, I applied more product and simply used the side of my fingers and the product blended beautifully! I appreciated how buildable the product was—it’s hard to defuse a strong pink blush but this blush was great because it started off as a bit “unpigmented” in my opinion but I ended up seeing it as a great product to be able to build depending on the look I was going for. I did not apply any powder blush on top of this product because I wanted to really see the finished product and I have to say it’s so beautiful and natural looking. This Peachy Keen shade is the perfect pink/peach tone I’ve been looking for! I will say there are other products I’ve tried that feel a bit more pigmented than this one but only this product has really nailed the perfect balance of a peachy pink blush! The only thing I was really not a fan of was the dual end brush. It felt rough on my skin and it almost felt like it made the product disappear as I used it to blend into my skin. I definitely recommend this product, and really commend ABH for this beautiful shade! I will attach two photos, the first is without adding a bit more product and the second it dabbing more using my fingers.","27 Jul 2021","Great for a Natural Look","Annabelle10101"

First off, I thought the packaging was very pretty and it looks awesome displayed on my makeup shelf. I found it somewhat easy to apply to my cheeks, but it did seem to accentuate more pores on my cheeks if I didn’t put a primer or other makeup under it. Cons - the brush is VERY scratchy, like so scratchy that I will never use it on my face again, so that is a bummer. I have one other stick blush with an attached brush, and that one in comparison is super soft. I also did not think the texture of this product was suitable for my lips. I was disappointed that it applied very patchy. Overall, I really want to love this blush, but since I rarely wear medium or full coverage foundation, this particular product did not seem to do much for my cheeks or lips. Also, given how abrasive the brush was on my face, I’m not sure I would recommend the product until this feature is improved.","27 Jul 2021","","LibbyLu4311"

The rose gold packaging is so pretty. The blush itself is a lovely texture. It applies so smoothly and is very creamy without feeling heavy. It is definitely buildable and lasts all day. The only qualm I have is that it’s not a clean formula, so it did aggravate my very sensitive, eczema prone skin. I’ll probably only use it on special occasions because I’m afraid that if I use it long term it will cause a more serious flare. It would be perfect for someone without sensitive skin.","27 Jul 2021","Lovely, but…","LaraGrog"

I already have numerous blush sticks in my makeup collection but this product was screaming out for me to try it. Of course I did and boy am I glad! I initially purchased one in the shade Latte and fell in love. The packaging is great as there is a blending brush on the opposite end of the blush. It makes it SO easy to use especially when you’re in a rush or on the go. The blush is creamy, goes on easily, blends so nicely, and it’s so easy to apply. Plus, the shades are beautiful for summer. I ended up purchasing four different shades AND I use the same shade of blush on my lips! Yeah, really! My fave is Peachy Keen. So after I apply the blush to my cheeks and blend it in, I then go to my lips which I line with a fairly neutral lip liner then I use the blush shade Peachy Keen and lightly tap it all over my lips. I’m just transferring the shade very lightly to my lips. Lastly, I place a spot of clear sparkly lip gloss at the center of my bottom lip and POW! Absolutely stunning!!!

The Pink Dhalia color is so gorgeous, a lovely tone of pink that works great with my medium complexion.

It comes in a gorgeous metallic case with the stick blush on one end and a brush on the other. The solid formula means no loose powder dusting everything in your toiletry bag. I used the peachy keen shade, which worked well on my Asian skin which has warm undertones. The blush was easy to apply and went on smoothly. Coverage was buildable which I liked. What kept the product from being a 5/5 was the fact that it wasn’t very easy to blend. The product says you can use your fingers to blend it in to your skin, but I found that you really need to use the brush to blend it. Just using your fingers usually leaves portions not fully blended. I’ve used the milk stick blush before and it blended much more easily. That being said, since the ABH stick comes with a brush that’s not a dealbreaker and I will continue to happily use it.","26 Jul 2021","","IYOl"

I received the color Latte, which I think may show up better on a lighter skin tone. I have medium toned skin, and it just gives a subtle wash, which I don’t mind. It has a nice creamy application, and doesn’t tug on my skin, and blends easily. I appreciate the brush on the other end of the stick, which is soft and screws off for easy cleaning. I don’t think I’d really use the brush side often but it’s convenient for on the go. The color doesn’t last all day unless I wear a primer and set it with a setting spray. Overall a good blush but expensive for the amount you get, which is why I removed a star.","25 Jul 2021","","djshin"

The color is gorgeous and blends really well when a firm brush is taken to the product then to the face. It was nice that a brush was included but I honestly didn’t find it useful in size or execution. Would use more if I was more of a dewy to natural finish fan, but will continue to use and set with a powder blush for my personal preference.","25 Jul 2021","","RhodyMiaC"

I just dot some on my cheeks and tap it into place as directed with the brush on the other end and in no time I have a beautifully natural looking flush of color to my cheeks. It blends beautifully, the texture of this product just looks like natural skin, a little bit goes a long way so I know I’ll have this product for a while even with daily use, and the price is pretty standard when I need to replace it. I got this product for free to review from Influenster and I’m so happy I got to try it out and that they sent me the perfect shade.

The Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Blush is so creamy but so lightweight at the same time, it melts over the skin making it so easy to blend. The color is well pigmented and looks so beautiful. The best part is that this blush is oil free, so it doesn't make my makeup heavier and is cruelty free. It came with a synthetic brush but I prefer to use my brushes to make the blending faster and effortless nevertheless is perfect to use in case of a emergency and to carry on my makeup bag.

It looks very beautiful and natural on my skin tone. However, the performance of it is all in how you apply it in my experience. When blending it out with the brush it comes with, I got patches. When applying it with a beauty blender, I found that it disappeared. I had an easier time applying it with my own brush on one cheek, but on the other side it got patchy. I feel like this is something that needs to be warmed up on the back of the hand, lightly dabbed on with fingers or a blush brush, and built up slowly. I also found that the wear is good when it’s set with either another blush or just a powder in general. This may not be something I reach for when I’m in a hurry and it won’t be in my everyday routine, but it’s a good travel product and a decent introduction to cream/stick products!","24 Jul 2021","","fayzah"

The color I received is also my perfect blush shade, which is hard for me to find as I don’t like ones that are too peachy or orange or too pink. This one is very natural and gives a nice glow from within flush of color without any shine or shimmer and not too matte. I can even apply this over powders if I want to set my foundation.

The other side of the stick has a brush but I personally use it it dab the edges a bit and then use a sponge to completely blend out. The brush makes it fade a bit more.

The brush is super soft and blends very well. It did not clog my pores or irritate. This fits right in with all of my other makeup products. Defiantly my new favorite and will continue to use. I used this only as a blush but it is full coverage for me so I can use it for my lip. The color is absolutely Beautiful with my skin tone and freckles.

Cons: matte finish can appear patchy, built in brush not very sold, on the pricier side. Typically I find that cream/stick blushes have a satin or luminous finish, so if you are in the market for something matte, this might be for you!","22 Jul 2021","Matte blush!","JMD2395"

For my normal/combination skin, I noticed several hours of wear except when I applied using the brush. The brush is way too stiff and pretty much useless, it takes off the product from my cheeks.

I have the shade pink dahlia in this blush and it’s such a pretty color, it’s a perfect pink flush on my fair skin. The blush can be built up if you want a more intense blush of sheered out for a more subtle blush, both ways look great. The packaging on this stick blush is super cute, blush stick on one end and a small brush on the other end (the brush is great for touch ups and on the go, but won’t replace your preferred blush brush when you’ve got that option). I think this is a solid option for people who want to try cream blush or prefer cream blush, these remind me of the NARS multiple sticks but creamier if you’ve ever used those.","22 Jul 2021","Easy to use, pretty color!","mary783"

The color works wonderfully with my neutral skin tone and adds a beautiful blush of color that looks natural and gives my skin a healthy glow.

Love how there’s the stick application so you don’t have to use your fingers like Fenty’s cream blush. The brush on the end is also an added bonus. Would definitely repurchase.","21 Jul 2021","Amazing!","hannahhenry21"

I’ve never found one that I love, but the formula is really creamy and I like that the Latte shade is kind of a mix of blush and bronzer in one! This lasted for quite a while on my cheeks and was pretty blendable as well with the cute little brush on the end!

I will say this product definitely had a bit of a learning curve for me, at first when applying directly from the stick I found that it went on way too heavy and was hard to blend out no matter what I used. However after playing around with it, I found that the brush on the end actually screws off (!!) so you can pick up product with it or unscrew it for cleaning which I think is awesome. Applying the product with the brush or even picking some up with your fingers and tapping it out gives a gorgeous blendable finish that made me fall in love with the product. The color is perfect with my skin tone, I would likely buy this product again.","21 Jul 2021","","beeedub"

And the color I got- Peach Caramel- is an almost exact copy of Nudestix Sunkissed or Deep Mapke, Eh- which are super similar to each other.  It’s nothing like the Mario Blush Stick, which I love but needs warmer colors.  Too bad, I was hoping to love this.  In the pic the middle one is the Anastasia Peach Caramel.

I really love this actually. But I’m not the biggest fan of the brush on the other side. It’s nice to throw in your purse, but not an ideal every morning brush. The biggest thing, is being it’s a creme product, it’s not ideal for oily skin. I find it can look greasy, fast if you’re in hot weather. But I’m sure this would be perfect for indoor events with AC! I really love the color too!","21 Jul 2021","So Pretty But Has Flaws","ItsKatKrazy"

I normally only use powder blushes because it’s so easy to dab and brush out, but this one really changed my mind about cream or stick blushes! I like that it’s dual-ended that comes with a mini brush so that I don’t have to use my finger or look for another brush to blend it out. This is so convenient. I can carry it on the go and when I travel. The shade Soft Rose which, just like its name, is a neutral deep rose shade that should be flattering on everyone. It’s very pigmented and at first I swiped on too much but it’s easily sheered out with the brush and some setting powder. It’s fairly long lasting on me too. Didn’t move for almost all day in the heat. I’m so glad I got a chance to try this and have already recommended to others.","21 Jul 2021","Great pigmentation with easy application","sphinxlikebecca"

I love that the blush is a cream formula which makes it easy to blend and glides on smoothly. The cream melts and blends onto my skin so it all looks flawless.  It’s also highly buildable which is a lot of fun especially if you like to play around with colors or if you want more intensity. 

What I love most of all is that the blush looks so natural on me, yet it gives me a nice warm glow and a nice contour.. I also LOVE that it comes with a little brush on the other end of the stick for blending! It’s so convenient to have it all in one piece!","20 Jul 2021","Smooth gliding!","SunshineFragran"

Latte is a beautiful, subtle rose with brown undertones that gives me the perfect no-makeup makeup look, which is my go-to these days. The rosy-brown tint is not muddy at all (which I was afraid of, looking at the dark swatches online). It works well with my skin tone (neutral light to light-medium) and, even with my slight summer tan, Latte wears as a very pretty, natural pink, adding just a bit of warmth and dimension to my complexion. (See the pics for an arm swatch as well as the blended blush below the swatch.) I like to wear it over just sunscreen during these hot CA summer days.

The formula is foolproof as well: goes on creamy, and not sticky at all; after blending, dries down and stays put for about four hours (longevity is not the best, but it's easy to pop in my purse and reapply as needed). Great for busy mornings!

I love my blinged-out blush sets and vibrant blushes, but this everyday-staple blush stick has won my heart as well.","20 Jul 2021","So Pretty. Blush Love!","comboskinview"

This was very easy to apply and buildable, however, can become very heavy-handed if not careful. I don’t like heavy makeup and this felt very light on my face and gave me a pleasant glow, without overdoing it. I only used a small amount of it on my face. It has a brush at one end to assist in blending in or you can just swipe on lightly and work in with your fingers. I personally appreciated the brush they provided even if it’s not the “best” brush but great when on the go or in a hurry. It’s a no-go for me on using for the lips since it went into the cracks and was too chalky.","20 Jul 2021","Great Cream Blush!","omiovi"

This shade (Peach Caramel) is gorgeous. I have medium warm olive skin and it just looks so natural and bronzey on me. The main problem I have with this product is that I don’t find it to be very creamy or blendable. Fingers actually work better than the brush to spread the product and help it meld with your skin. I find the formula overall to be kind of dry, stiff, and not that user friendly. If you have oily skin, this might be a good thing for you. But for me with dry skin, I just don’t think this formula plays nicely.","20 Jul 2021","fine but not a standout","harlotry"

I do occasionally wear blush, but sparingly as most power blushes dry my skin out and cream blushes rub off quickly (even with primer & setting spray).  First, the packaging here is fantastic!  I love the rose gold case - very sturdy and perfect for a travel makeup bag.  At first I was skeptical about the blending brush. What you see in the image is the extent of the brush.  It's very firm and doesn't fan, but it blended PERFECTLY!  I had an absolutely flawless application that looked perfectly soft and natural. The best part?  It actually lasted all day!  Again, I'm thrilled to have discovered Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Cream Blush.  It's definitely going in my permanent beauty arsenal.","20 Jul 2021","Best cream blush I've ever used!

Upon opening the box the gold package is elegant. When the tube of blush slid out I hate to say it but it’s the prettiest makeup in my collection now. I like the stick blush with blender as well. This is my first of this kind past an ELF highlighter which I used as blush. Application was easy as well as blending. I have hand issues and it was large enough to hold, grasp, apply pressure on, and blend with. The brush attached on the other end was surprisingly easy to use. It did not over absorb the makeup and spread it well. It did not drag on my skin pulling it either. I like the subtle blush it left and the fact that if I keep applying it it will be more pigmented. Now that I am exposed to her wonderful products I am sure I will stay with this as my go to blush. I guess a few more shades would be nice. This gave me a very natural look which I am liking in my older age. The everyday look for me is natural and it was so easy to apply I can see people who like blush really like this product. I am honestly blown away and they have gained a fan. Maybe when i need to replace this stick they will have a few more colors :) One can hope! I would recommend this item to people I know. I attached a picture of the blush on my clean skin or natural and then another swatch of one heavy swipe.","19 Jul 2021","I really liked this blush. Great for on the go too","lunabeeee"

It’s a true cream to powder and blends absolutely beautifully. It’s such a great opacity that is easily buildable but is not overwhelming and sticky like some similar blush products. The color that I used is absolutely wonderful on my fair skin and doesn’t apply heavily out of the tube. It lasts for hours, and is now my go to blush. 

The downside is the brush that comes with it. It’s convenient that it’s at the bottom of the tube but the brush is so tiny and the hair are so short that it does a terrible job of blending the product. I think if people just used that brush they would be unhappy with the product overall. However, using a regular brush this product just shines.","19 Jul 2021","Awesome product but terrible brush","cynmrose12"

Both ways seemed to remove the product off more. I also found the color didn’t last as long on my face and I had to reapply throughout my day.

In the past, I’ve had a hard time getting color payoff and it took a lot of product. Not with this! It’s hydrating, easy to manipulate over your cheeks and the pigment is everything! It literally melts into your skin! I’m rather fair and even with great pigment, it isn’t intimidating. I honestly haven’t even tried the brush yet. I just use my finger. Talk about convenient! I love the color (Peachy Keen) and hope they come out with more shades! This leaves the most beautiful glow on my cheeks and compliments my skin making it look even healthier. It’s a great color and product for year round wear. The packaging is also 10/10.","17 Jul 2021","Gorgeous Color!","BloggerDanielle"

It is very creamy and pigmented. The color is beautiful on my skin tone. Since I have received it I have added it to my everyday look. On my skin tone it contours beautifully and I take it a across my nose lightly for a blurred filter look. It’s very easy to apply but highly pigmented so be sure to build it lightly. The only thing I didn’t love is the brush on the other end. It kind of sweeps the product right off so I used my own brush and blender ball.

It’s actually super super light on the skin and blends beautifully even with finger application. The pigment is amazing so you don’t need too much! This blush has a velvety/natural finish with a thin consistency and it has no scent and is pretty long wearing. The brush on the other end is also a plus if you travel with makeup a lot, so a separate brush is one less thing to worry about!

The color and formula is reminiscent of my current holy grail cream blush from a different company, and if it wasn't for the huge price difference, this one would replace it. Super easy to apply (in fact, too easy to over apply but thanks to the built in brush you could blend/sheer it out the way you like it). Wearability throughout the day was excellent - pictures do not do the color payoff justice as it looks wonderfully natural in person. Once I finish the product, I'll definitely be keeping the brush component to reuse, as it is quite soft and comes in handy the way the packaging provides it's own cover - great for traveling! As far as purchasing in the future, I'll have to wait for either a sale or perhaps if I have been given a Sephora gift card, this may make it into my cart...If price is not a factor in your purchasing power, would recommend this blush in a heartbeat if you're in the market for a cream brush.","17 Jul 2021","New Holy Grail Blush?

The brush is better for concentrated areas and the sponge spreads the product out easier. 
I also got all day wear out of this while working on my truck in 90 degree heat with a high humidity index. I will also be taking this for a summer car show where I will be in the sun again.

It’s very creamy and gives nice coverage/pigmentation, and the brush on the other end makes blending it after application super easy. The peachy color gives a lovely and natural flushed look, and is the perfect shade for summer. I’ve been wearing it all day and am very happy with the staying power this has.

I am a huge fan of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics. The cream blush stick is a great new product. I love that it has the product on one side and the built in brush on the other side. I also like that it is paraben and sulfate free. Not only can you use this as a blush but it also works as a lip product as well! It glides on very nicely. It is buildable so if you want a sheet look, swipe on a thin application or if you want more coverage, add more product and blend it out until you have achieved the desired look. For a fresh all over look, dab a little on the bridge of the nose and blend up into the forehead. The blush stays put once I blend it out and lasts all day until I wash my face with soap and water. This is a really great blush. It will be a staple in my makeup bag. It is so convenient to have a great quality brush built right in to the stick and there is a good amount of product on the blush side of the stick. I love this delivery method. There are a variety of shades so everyone will find the shade or shades that work well for their skin. This is also a great product for a beginner makeup user because it is so easy to use and doubles as a lip product. It is sophisticated and high quality enough for the most experienced makeup enthusiast also. I recommend Anastasia Beverly Hills Creme Blush Stick for everyone looking for a high quality blush that I radiant and lasts all day and is easy to apply. It is definitely worth splurging on this blush! Buy it...you will be happy you did!!!","17 Jul 2021","Great Cream Blush Stick and Brush from Anastasia!","Andie401"

Its pretty much identical to nudestix in sunkissed, but with a hint more red / purple in it. Sunkissed can pull a bit orange on me depending on my makeup base, but not this guy. I am obsessed. It looks so natural on, I look glowy and like Ive been in the sun a little too long. Flushed. I really like the formula, its more emollient and blendable than the nudestix, so easier to use. I like setting it with a powder blush so it lasts longer. Will absolutely repurchase this once I run out of this and sunkissed. Such a great find, thanks Influenster and Anastasia for sending this over for review. Also looks super nice on the eyes, with a bit of a shimmer shadow on top. So effortless and cool and just beautiful. Also added benefit, im not sure what is up with the color or formula, but I feel it helps my freckles look better.","16 Jul 2021","Summer in a stick","MINA7777"

The ABH stick blush is very creamy. It blends extremely easily, does not break the foundation, is very buildable, does not feel heavy, and doesn't accentuate pores, texture, or dry patches. Pink Dahlia is such a pretty pinkish shade. This blush is for people that are intimidated by it because the pigment isn't intense is more natural. You have to build it up to get full pigmentation. The brush is of good quality, it doesn't move the foundation or leave streaks, but I think it is too small for blush. Instead of the brush, more product could have been added. Another con is that the blush faded through the day, even setting it with loose powder; It lasted for 6 hours. I think this product is good, and it does do what it claims to do, which is be seamless and a second-skin finish.","16 Jul 2021","","Mjchelle"

Firstly the packaging is amazing.It’s a shiny rose gold. The shininess of the packaging makes it easy to spot in your drawer or in your bag. Love that this product is a two in one. The blush applicator is on one end and the brush is on the other. The consistency of the product is very creamy a little goes a long way. Unfortunately this color does not show up very well on dark skin but I like this product so much I would be willing to purchase it in a deeper shade. Took off one star due to the fact that it does not show on all skin tones.","16 Jul 2021","Nice product","Jnine55"

That being said the opinions are mine alone. This product is great. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It gives a nice soft glow of color that looks natural. I love the brush that comes on one end, it really helps diffuse the color across the cheekbones. The color also suits my skin tone really well. I am hard to match as my skin tone can change from warm to cool toned depending on my tan level. Will define buy as soon as I run out of this one.","16 Jul 2021","Perfect wash of color.","Hurricanebub"

I  received this for a review from Influenster and I'm so happy I did. This blush is a gorgeous rose color and blends out so well. It's buildable and doesn't exaggerate my already large pores. I  don't really use foundation so I can't say how well it works on top of it. The only problem I had was with the brush end it seems to pick up the product instead of blending it out.","16 Jul 2021","Love the blush","aimeeC90"

I love cream blushes, especially sticks, but the best one I own is four dollars from a drugstore. The pink Dahlia color is a nice cool toned pink that adds a pop, and seems to last most of the day. The consistency is pretty dry which makes it hard to blend. And the packaging is pretty excessive, just too much plastic and an unnecessary brush on the end that really only serves to remove the product. I was lucky enough to receive this as a complementary product for review, but wouldn’t re-purchase unfortunately!","16 Jul 2021","not it…","ek85"
