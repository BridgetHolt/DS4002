The blush itself is beautiful, the formulation with the blush and highlighter is really great. However, this is the worst packaging I have ever seen. I bought one blush and within the first month it was shattered. I thought maybe it was by my mistake. I bought a second blush in another color and within a week of it going from my counter to my makeup bag, it was shattered. After reading many reviews and talking to Sephora employees, this seems to be a very common occurrence with this blush. I can no longer wear it because it’s a mess whenever I open it, therefore I rate the blush a 1. It’s such a shame because I have loved everything from Rare Beauty, but I’m not wasting my money on products that fall apart at the slightest touch. If they fix the issue, I’ll buy every shade.","beautyjunkie03","22 d ago"

I DEF RECOMMEND 💗💗","I got this blush during the sale so maybe I'm a bit biased 🤭🤭 but OH MY GOSH it is amazing. The glow this product gives me is goddess material, the colour is amazing, and the packaging is beautiful. If you want something similar to the highlighter but also want a pop of colour this is for you. I will say it was just a little bit hard to blend out and once it's on it's on for hours, so I wouldn't recommend this for everyday or for subtle looks, but if you want to pop and be that girl then this is 100% the way to go. Also try this on in store before you buy, the shade joy is not as orange as it seems. I was a bit scared of the colour at first but when a i tried it on irl it was amazing. I heard it's very fragile, I haven't had any problems though so idk.  I tried the cream blush too and if this much shimmer (it's really shimmery) is not your taste, I would look into the rare beauty cream blush!

Also, I know a lot of people say match the powder with your liquid blush, I don't necessarily agree. I have the colour hope in the liquid form and I got joy in the powder. They match amazingly.

I absolutely love the colour and the formula is INCREDIBLE! It gives you a natural, glowing-from-within look without any glitter settling into your pores. Let's be real, everyone has pores, and it's time to accept that nobody walks around with a Paris filter on their face. While you'll see your pores with this product, it's much less noticeable compared to other brands. This blush wears more beautifully than Hourglass, yes, I said it! It gives that perfect bright, wet, glow-from-within look with just a touch of brightness.

I don’t have a lot of texture in my face but this blush emphasizes me my pores A LOT, like A LOT. It didn’t sit too well on top of my makeup. It’s sheer but buildable. I bought the shade happy and Joy and I wanted happy to be more of a pale cool pink but I felt like it had purple undertones (if that makes sense). Shade is more on the orangey peachy side. These blushes aren’t all that in my opinion and were disappointing from the second I first tried them on. I would never buy these again","MYCHEMICALROM","8 Jul 2024"

I like how buildable the pigment is, it’s not too much or too little. It blends super nicely, but I will say it is more like a highlighter than a blush, but not as luminous as the liquid illuminizer.

If you try to work it in it just gets too pigmented and ends up looking like clownish. I even tried applying to the back of my hand first and tried using a couple different brushes, with no luck.

I usually wear it to show up on camera so I add a decent amount. The main downside is, like the highlighter, they're very fragile and prone to breaking. It's so sad because I love it so much. It's very glowy on the cheeks which I love. To get the most pigment I would use a brush intended for creams, which may be how it broke so fast. But they feel more like creams than powders to me, though they are technically powders, there are silicones and other creamy ingredients inside.

IDK, this just goes on super blotchy on my skin and looks ridiculous (I have clear skin and have not had this issue with any other foundation, contour, conealer, blush, or highlight).  

The pigment is lowkey embarrassing no matter how light handed I am and whenever I try to ""blend it away"", as the instructions say, it seems to get worse. I've tried to use it for like a month and it just isn't hitting for me. I kept trying to find videos of people applying it and it looking good, but weirdly no one is posting any (conspiracy....)

But the shade ""Joy"" by Rare Beauty gives me that true orange peek-a-boo pop I was wanting with a pinch of disco shine. Here in the picture collage you can tell and clearly see the difference.

It's basically an expensive blush and highlighter combined into one. It's shimmery but not glittery and the level of pigmentation from Happy is perfect for me as someone with cool pale skin. A single dab or two with my brush is all I need to add a nice pop of pink and highlight to my cheeks and nose. I only wore MISSHA Glow Skin Balm under this blush and it lasted all day for me, and I had no problems blending it. One caveat, though, that I saw and heard from video reviews is that it can highlight texture. I think this may be because of the shimmer. I didn't have that problem myself, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing.

This is dry on the cheeks and patchy. I prefer a smooth and plumping effect on my cheeks; maybe if this was a cream to powder formula, I would have liked it. I did think the concept could be pretty, innovative, and the look in photos/video is nice. I had to be realistic though, is this pretty in everyday real life or just metallic dust on the cheeks.

I feel like this blush gives the perfect gradient transition from where your highlighter strobes to this blush's soft shimmer down to whatever your base is so the whole look appears more cohesive instead of just having stark highlighter on an otherwise matte face.

I'm 44 and have dry skin with some texture and fine lines and I know a lot of people are turned off by how luminous these are but OH MY GOD, Joy and Truth are gorgeous! Swatched in-store and that sold me!
I put Joy on top of other peach or coral blushes and it gives the most healthy, juicy and lit from within glow. It actually makes the high points of my face appear a bit more full and juicy so it almost looks as though I got a small amount of filler, if that makes any sense. 
Applied in the wrong spot (on me- the apples of the cheeks),they would definitely emphasize texture but hey, I have skin and I'm over 40- it is what it is...
For reference, I disliked the Bare Minerals blonzers but these are so so so soft and velvety and the luminosity doesn't read as glitter but as shimmer-in my opinion.
I found the lighter pink colours to look a bit muddy since the pigment seemed a bit light for my skin tone and the highlight/reflect that showed through was also too light, almost leaving a cast. But Joy just looks like summer on my face and warms up my skin tone in the healthiest way.
I want to get Truth so badly but I'll wait until the Winter sale if I can curb my impulse to buy it right away :) Swatched lightly, Truth was absolutely gorgeous. Swatched on top of other blushes and it was just phenomenal!","WafflesnOJ","10 Apr 2024"

I like to keep the blush further back towards my cheekbones and tap over it with a sponge to reduce some of the reflective shine. These blushes are definitely glow, so they may not be everyone's preference. But I don't find them to be unflattering.","CaitYates","10 Apr 2024"

It just looked SO orange in the pan, and I’m wary about luminous blushes because I don’t want to accentuate texture on my cheeks. However, after swatching it on my hand, I fell in love. The powder melts into the skin and creates such a gorgeous dimension of color. Seriously, don’t sleep on Rare’s powder formulas. They go on so silky and don’t emphasize my textured cheeks. If you buy one blush this spring, make it this new luminous blush in Joy. It gives a universally flattering warmth to the face, and the peach tone couldn’t be more on trend.","soro47","10 Apr 2024"

This is the perfect addition to any liquid blush. I am very pale and usually cool toned products look better on me and the shade Happy compliments my skin tone very well. This adds the perfect shimmer to where you don't need highlighter and even if you don't like or use highlighter you can go in with a light hand and it won't be too overpowering. These are quite buildable in a good way! The only thing I will say is if you have large pores or textured skin this might emphasize texture so be careful.

I am reading some of the reviews which states “not for every day use” or doesn’t last long- IMO these blushes are for every day use, if you wear highlighter and blush, these gems are for you. They do last a very long time. My makeup lasts all day long and then some. These blushes are absolutely stunning, the formula is soft and silky, It’s not a blush that you rub on your skin with a brush, you need to gently swipe. These are definitely worth the purchase, especially if you use blush and highlighter.","Msjess81","8 Apr 2024"

Knowing how much I dislike the powder highlight, I shouldn't have purchased this blush but I took a chance and I regret it. Like the highlight, this blush so intensely glittery, almost obnoxiously so, that even with a light hand and buffing it into my skin, my cheeks are covered in sparkles. It emphasized pores and fine lines I don't even have. The shade Happy is light pink but warmer than the liquid blush version, with more ""shine"" than color as the pigmentation isn't very buildable...unless I wanted even more glitter on my face. 
Makeup is extremely subjective and clearly people love this but it's not for me. I'm already very fair, I don't need blush making me look like a Twilight vampire when I step into the sun.","cara80","7 Apr 2024"

It was so pigmented that the product would end up lasting me a few months. They blended out seamlessly with a brush, beauty blender, or simply my finger. I found that if there was too much pigment, I would take a damp beauty blender and lightly pat the area until it was diffused to my liking.

I think there's some important things to consider about this product if you're debating picking it up. I would describe these more as a blush-highlighter hybrid, leaning more toward being a highlight.

The shimmers in these are visible on the skin, especially in direct sunlight so if that's not your vibe you should skip these for now.","Sarakate2","6 Apr 2024"

The lighter shades are definitely more of a highlighter than a blush, which is why I recommend using over liquid / cream blush.","abbbsss3","6 Apr 2024"

I was worried this blush would be too glowy for my textured, acne-prone skin. However I find the best way for me to use this is to apply it on my cheekbones rather than over the pores on the apples of my cheeks. I also like to tap over the blush with a sponge to take down some of the shine. This blush is truly stunning and doesn’t overly emphasize texture. However if you apply it over pores, it will definitely make them more noticeable. I also appreciate that there isn’t any glitter in the blush.","CaitYates","4 Apr 2024"

The blushes are a very soft, easy to blend, formula, perfect for any skin tone! My usage tips are 1) buy their brush, it blends it much better and more beautifully; and 2) avoid any area of texture.

The product itself is a home run, it’s stunning! I’ve been looking for a glowy blush for a while and have tried many other more expensive brands (Hourglass being one), and this one is the best by far. It’s a true glow without chunky glitter. You can forego highlighter with this,and using a light hand will give you a fresh, natural look. The packaging is just like the highlighters, small, round and dome shaped. Would be easy to travel with (but more on that below). 

Cons:
It’s not the product that’s the issue, it’s the packaging. It’s such a delicate formula it shatters almost without any assistance. In part this can be caused by rough shipping, but in part it is the design of the product also. If it were made into a flat shape vs a dome or pressed more, it would likely have a better chance of survival. I’ve bought 2 rare beauty highlighters and they are my favorite, but they break immediately and therefore you cannot travel with them.  It’s super disappointing because they are AMAZING products but they WILL break.","Lvrh8me","4 Apr 2024"

It seems like most positive reviews are written by people who received the product for free, but this blush was a major letdown. I was super excited when i heard rare was finally coming out with powder blushes, but this is more of a highlight than blush - and not a very forgiving one. This will emphasize any slight texture you might have so bad. I don't usually ever have that problem on my cheeks and it just looked awful in every lighting. On top of the texture issue, the color looked very muddy on my skin tone, which was unfortunate because i loveee the liquid blush in the same shade.","tols","3 Apr 2024"

Very similar to the highlighter formula. These are very luminous too. It appears as if they have fine mica in them, so they do have a somewhat shimmery effect. The pigment is very buildable and the formula blends out quite nice, but like many luminous products, it will emphasize texture if you have large pores . I find these to be really pretty but I wouldn’t use highlighter to top it off. They are almost a blush /highlighter hybrid. So adding highlighter is unnecessary. It Layers well on top the soft pinch liquid blush. Actually, I feel like I like using the soft pinch liquid blush as the pigment/blush and then using this to top off more where highlight would be placed. The color joy is a warm peach. I prefer to use only 1-2 swipes  of this on my lighter skin, perhaps in the summer I could build up the pigment more. The packaging is similar to the highlighters but matte. Love the minimalist aesthetic. In the picture I have a swatch of cheer and joy so you can see what one swipe of color looks light on my light skin with neutral undertones.","MarissaIwanowsk","3 Apr 2024"

I like blushes that I can wear when I don’t have a full face of makeup on, and I feel like this one is natural enough that I can do just that. I like the texture of the blush too because it applies easily but definitely has a stronger pigment so you don’t need much. Gifted by rarebeauty","steviegidden","3 Apr 2024"

Powder blush for the win","#rarebeautygiftedme As soon as I received the Soft Pinch Blush a week ago, I incorporated it into my everyday routine. I gave myself a week of use to really get a sense of the wearability and practicality of it.

After one week of daily use, I can tell you that this blush is something I will continue to reach for. It is easily blendable and buildable but does not fade away throughout the day like many other formulas I have tried. It also has this slight radiant finish that I LOVE!! I’ve previously only used matte blush formulas but I’m loving the sun-kissed look the radiance gives. It works wonderfully with a full face of foundation AND when I just want to throw some blush on over a bare face. I have a medium olive skin tone and normally reach for lighter pink shades, so I was a little nervous to try this peachy shade but it did not disappoint at all!!! The shade truly works on many skin types (I tried it on my sister who has a more fair complexion and my best friend who has a deeper complexion). When I am wearing full foundation, I use the Rare Beauty liquid blush version (in the same shade) and then pair the powder version on top once I’ve applied all my powders. They work so beautifully together but can also be used separately. For example, when it’s a bare face day, I use just the powder and it lasts me all day!! 10/10 recommend, can’t wait to try out the other shades!!","gabrielamykah27","3 Apr 2024"

So far my experience with each has been different lol. In this review I’m showcasing the shade Hope. I found this shade to lack actual pigmentation. On my cheek the majority of what was visible was bright pink shimmer. If I tried to build up the blush for more pigment all I would get is moreeee shimmer. I felt the actually color pay off of this shade to be very minimal and the shimmer to be very intense. I think the particular shade Hope will work best as a topper than an actual blush in terms of my preferences. This however was not my experience with the shade Joy. I have to submit that one separately. This product was gifted by rare beauty.","meganhowdy","2 Apr 2024"

This is for a glowy cheek lover, no highlight needed. Pigmented, but the baked formula makes it easy to pick up just how much product you want to load your brush with.

On my light-medium complexion, it reads more as a blush topper, but definitely buildable. Will accentuate skin texture, so place intentionally.

My hopes were high for this to be the magic solution, but it ended up being a bit of a disappointment. Yeah, it looks amazing before you use it and it does give your face a nice glow, but it also highlights uneven skin more than I'd like.The quality of the highlighter itself is really solid. You can tell they put effort into making it feel premium and blend well. However, it fell short by emphasizing the uneven parts of my skin, which was exactly what I didn't want. People with smoother skin will probably get a kick out of how it enhances their features. But for someone with texture issues like me, it kind of feels like it's just drawing attention to what you're trying to hide.In the end, even with all the good stuff about Rare Beauty's highlighter, I've got to pass on it. It's a great product for sure, just not suited for folks with textured skin. The search for the ideal summer highlighter goes on for me, but now I've got a better idea of what to look for and what to steer clear of for my skin type.","Naydwan","1 Apr 2024"

I've got oily skin and thought this powder would be awesome when it gets hot out. I was hoping this would be the one, but it kinda let me down. Sure, it looks great in the pan and even makes your face light up in a cool way, but it also made my skin's rough patches stick out more than I wanted.The stuff in the highlighter is pretty top-notch; it's obvious they tried to make something that feels good on your skin and is easy to use. But, it did the one thing I didn't want it to do – made my bumpy skin more noticeable. If you've got smooth skin, you'll probably love how it shines and brings out your best bits. But if you're dealing with skin like mine, it might just point out the stuff you're trying to play down.So, even though Rare Beauty's highlighter has some great things going for it, I have to say it's not for me. It's a shame because it's a really nice product, just not right for someone dealing with skin texture issues. I'm still on the hunt for that perfect highlighter for the warmer months, but now I know a bit more about what works and what doesn't for my skin.","Naydwan","1 Apr 2024"

This product is amazing for a luminous blush look. It truly is like their liquid blush and powder highlight had a baby. Cheer is such an amazing shade.

This is such a beautiful blush, with a natural plumping effect and extremely cute colors that have made many women fascinated. It is unexpectedly smooth and incredibly weightless. This blush is as smooth as silk, giving the feeling of dissolving and blending smoothly into the skin immediately upon application. Besides, it also adds emulsion, so when applied to the cheeks, it will create the effect of naturally flushed and plump cheeks. The most attractive point of this blush is that it is easy to stick to and long-lasting with a natural-looking dimension. I love the design in a cute small, compact box, easy to carry anywhere, especially when traveling.

It’s highly pigmented so you don’t need too much product, just a little product tapped onto the cheeks and you have the perfect blushing glow! It also lasted all night long. I got the shade cheer and it is the perfect warm light pink color. Gifted by rare beauty, but this is my honest review.","aud2019","31 Mar 2024"

It’s definitely buildable which you can see if swatched with fingers, but blended well and still deposited a lot of pigment with a blush brush.

This really is such a gorgeous concept and I will definitely be using this blush from now on.","YesiiS","28 Mar 2024"

This formula is extremely glowy but picks up less easily than their highlighters (where just one dab can be way too much). In my books that's a good thing as I could build up the color intensity slowly. Because it is so glowy it looked a bit metallic when I really built up the color, but I didn't find my pores to be emphasized more than usual with a glowy blush.  The formula seemed less shiny and glossy than their highlighter formula which I was relieved by. The shade Hope has a slightly warmer base with cool pink reflects. I can see the pink shine on my face still, and if that type of duochrome is not for you, I'd go for a different shade.","TeresaAntonia","28 Mar 2024"
