The applicator isn’t practical on its own and you would need a beauty blender or brush. It’s not as pigmented as I hoped, as it took many taps to see the color on my cheek. Otherwise the shade is really pretty and texture is creamy.","5 Jan 2025","Almost Just Air","Cantarella"

The way the packaging is, makes it very difficult to save your product. It leaks out inside the cap and outside because it has a twist too. It also looses a LOT of product if you decide to take it on the plane because of the pressure. There will be nothing you can do other than maybe save it in a different container but risk for contamination. Overall I’d love to see the formula in a different packaging because it’s pigmented and lasts but it also needs to be applied over maybe not liquid foundation because I found it took some of it off as I tried blending it in and it left patches on my amface.","29 Nov 2024","Like the formula but packaging wastes product!",""

At first I was blending it out with a beauty blender, so it seemed like there was no color payoff. however I've learnt that it's best to blend it out with a brush, and mostly on the outer edges. I do layer it with powder blush but it is an extremely long lasting combo. and a little goes a long way if you blend it out right and mostly at the edges. yes it is pricy, and it doesn't take long for it to seem like the tube is mostly finished, but that's deceiving.

You have to layer with a powder blush to even bring out any color. This isn’t the pop of pink I was expecting.

The wand more expensive than other liquid blushes because there’s more product in the tube - about 86% more than Rare Beauty’s standard size.

Just no. I'm sorry but what? I'm paying 42$ for something that has a huge percentage of the product gone? Now, don't get me wrong or even start with me but the formula could be better but it could work. Here, whats bothering me is the packaging. number one it absorb an ABSURD amount of product leaving you with less then half the original amount of product and ngl if it was elf that's not too much money I wouldn't be upset about it but 42$ for a blush that you don't even get half of the product and makes a HUGE mess leaving you with about 25% of the original product. I'm sorry but isn't worth it will never be but the formula could use work but it okay its just the fact I'm left with 25% of the product at the end that I've spent 42$ on I'll pass take it down or upgrade the packaging by removing the applicator and add in something that doesn't absorb like a pump or something like that.

The formula is long-lasting and doesn’t budge in the humid summer. It’s also fragrance free. I can’t stand the sponge applicator and also found applying the product directly to my face was too much. Instead, I put a dot on my hand, evenly coat a dense brush and apply before powder. This allows me to blend out easier with foundation leftover on my sponge if it goes on too heavy. Also, since I don’t apply it directly to my face, I bought little jars and just emptied the tube into a small jar. So much cleaner and nicer than the sponge. The pink is my favorite. I tried the peach but found it a little much for my complexion. I also like mixing the matte mauve PT wand with the Pinkgasm wand for a little something extra. They mix beautifully together.","30 Dec 2023","Pink, Mauve/Pillow Talk, and Peach","g1ngerg1l79"

I have a personal criteria for cream blushes to appease my eczema. 3 stars for the performance of the formula. This formula blends well with a brush and it is buildable. You have to blend quickly because this blush sets. It's a beautiful soft matte finish that doesn't feel dry!

Minus 2 stars in terms of limited color range and for the packaging. There is little accessibility for skin tones in the matte wands. I have to adjust the rest of my makeup in order to make the slightly bluey cherry undertone of Dream Pop work with my olive undertone. The formula alone works well and lasts a while, it just needs more shades so others can enjoy it.

Cleaning the sponge is a bit of a hassle. I have to lock the tip, wipe off the excess and then wash the entire sponge until the water runs clear. It feels like a waste of product, but this is the only way I can truly clean it. I have to frequently clean my makeup and tools to minimize eczema flare ups, so I don't usually reach for this for sanitary reasons.","8 Jun 2023","Cute, but not for me","sumlem"

If you like liquid blushes, I think you’ll really like this one. It is VERY concentrated so you only need a tiny (and I mean tiny) bit for your cheeks. I’m wearing Dream Pop which is a vibrant, deep, cool cherry. After you twist off the cap, make sure the arrow is pointed to the ON position then give it a little squeeze so it floats up to the sponge tip. I didn’t read the directions carefully and kept trying to squeeze it in the OFF position. This blends very easily without feeling or looking greasy or dewy. I like the convenience of the tube because it easily fits into your makeup bag and it’s secure. This is long wearing, cruelty free and free of Sulfates SLS and SLES.

I received this products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review.

It’s easy to blend and the puff applicator is fine. I’m neutral on the packaging. It probably would be better with a pump. 

I really recommend trying it. It’s got a big price tag but it’s so incredibly gorgeous on! Lasts all day. Very easy to blend and a true matte baby pink.

The packaging was good looking yet simple and easy to identify what was inside. The wand itself was a perfect size for hand control and I like that the applicator tip is twist to open/close so that there is no spillage. The one caution I would say is use a light hand when “dobbing” the sponge tip to your cheek or only put one dot as a little goes a long way. It was nice to be able to blend it in with the applicator tip instead of a separate sponge too. I found the coverage was good and I liked the color. I did like the color with my complexion and if you’re looking for a quick, easy pop of color to your cheeks I recommend giving this wand by Charlotte Tilbury a try.","14 Apr 2023","Compact, easy to use & my new go to!","jobell2355"

I think it is crucial to get to blending right away once you apply this. Their formula isn’t one where you can map out all your highlight contour blush conceal/colorful correct zones and then get to blending. You want to blend before you’re stuck with dots or streaks because the formula is already drying 
Was this blush easy to use? Sorta. I’m used to powder format for blush but also the other cream formulas I use like my wax based foundation are much more blendable and less of a drying cream. 

This blush is subtle on me, but does seem to stay long lasting as long as you set it with spray and/or powder.","13 Apr 2023","Use it often but I’m not sure it’s a favorite yet","jenninsocal"

It’s a powerhouse when it comes to lasting power and last well upto 10 hours on me when I took it off. The colour I picked was Pink Pop. Right out of the tube it does look more peachy but as you can see on the skin  and once blended it’s a neutral bright pink colour. Note that the wand has a locking mechanism which you can use by twisting the head to close/open it. It’s $52 CAD for 12mL of product and is on the pricier side but it is high quality and worth it.","7 Apr 2023","Long lasting vibrant pink blush","Rodella"

The sponge tip is small, but works great. The color pigment itself goes on a bit thin… and it comes out pretty wet.

The only one I don’t have is pop so I can’t speak for that one. I think these are so covenant to use and great for a quick 10 minute everyday look. As well as for a full glam look when I layer it with a powder blush. I never have a problem with them looking patchy or disturbing the foundation underneath regardless of the foundation. They can be a light wash of color or built up. They are long lasting even if I don’t apply a powder blush on top. And as long as you lock the top I never have a problem with it leaking out product. Sometimes I don’t even push out more product and leave it locked while using product on the sponge from the day prior. Which helps the sponge not get too much buildup on it. I know people complain that there’s a lot of air in the tube but I use mine often and still don’t run through them quickly and feel they are worth the price because I love them so much. I think the colors are beautiful and these will be a repurchase for me!","24 Mar 2023","My Favorite cream blush","KMC2288"

I am a light medium olive undertone with slight yellow over tones and I always love how this shade of pink cancels out the sallowness and makes me look refreshed. The formula blurs your skin and reminds me of the effect a foundation would have but in a blush form, but it doesn't feel heavy like a foundation at all.
Just remember to turn the end to on to squeeze out a little and then turn it to the ""OFF"" setting once you have enough product out.
I would even recommend keeping it off for the next few uses until you need more product on the tip, that's what has worked for me in using the other Charlotte Tilbury highlight and contour wands.","19 Mar 2023","Sweet petal pink blush","sweetpea377"

Let me get this out there first, I know cream/liquid blushes are the trendy thing this past year, but I’m a powder blush person through and through. So take whatever I say with this in mind because I know this has gotten positive reviews from influencers and makeup artists that I’ve seen.

For starters, I just don’t love this packaging. I know it’s the same as the contour and light wands that were a big hit, but it’s messy to me. It does have a twist lock so it doesn’t all come out through the sponge if it gets squeezed in your makeup bag. I just mean that it’s messy because I have to put it on my hand first to pick up with a stippling brush or pick it up off the tip with my finger and dab it on. When I wiped it on my hand and used a stippling brush to pick it up, it applied and blended flawlessly without disturbing my foundation. 
It felt somewhat heavy on my cheeks and like it may have smeared or transferred to everything if I hadn’t set it down with translucent powder. One perk of the tackiness I mentioned is that it seemed to really last with no fading even after a heavy sweat filled workout. 

This name of this product is Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush which is a bit misleading. I don’t feel like it is truly matte other than the fact that there is no shimmer or glitter in the formula. The tackiness ended up giving me a glossy glowy look even after applying translucent powder. With the word matte in the product name, i was expecting something with some type of silicone or dimethicone base. 

Take from this what you will because it is not a bad product, but just different than what I was expecting from the name. I just wanted to give an idea about the consistency for anyone considering purchasing this item so they would know what they were getting. I can definitely see someone with drier skin or even someone who loves cream products enjoying this.","12 Mar 2023","Sort of tacky/heavy feeling","lucy062"

The color is so pretty on my light skin and just works for me, but also it lasts incredibly well which I wasn’t expecting. Seriously all day long! And it blends so buttery. The things that make me probably not repurchase is the packaging, the lid didn’t stay on very well so the product hardened on the tip of the applicator so it couldn’t squeeze out anymore product. It did have a open/close feature but that didn’t help so sadly after a couple uses I can’t anymore. Then on top of that there is not a good amount of product.","11 Mar 2023","Pretty but disappointing","balienlabs"

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the results. As someone who has had mixed experiences with liquid blushes in the past, I was initially skeptical of this product. However, after trying it out, I can confidently say that it is a game-changer.

One of the standout features of this blush is its blendability. It glides on smoothly and is easy to blend in, without leaving any harsh lines or uneven patches. Additionally, it feels incredibly lightweight on the skin, which is a major plus for those who prefer a more natural look.

The shade of the blush that I tried was also stunning. It was the perfect balance of pigmented and subtle, giving me a healthy, natural-looking flush. I also appreciate that it comes in a wand format, which makes it incredibly easy to apply and control the amount of product used.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Charlotte Tilbury Matte Beauty Blush Wand to anyone looking for a high-quality liquid blush. It truly exceeded my expectations and has become a new staple in my makeup routine. Thank you to the Charlotte Tilbury team for the opportunity to try this product!","9 Mar 2023","Game changer for liquid blush lovers","ShadesOfRose"

For the photos I only did one application and it was enough to give a slight flushed look to add color to my face. The Peach Pop shade looked more reddish on my skin tone and it is buildable if you want the color to really be obvious on your skin in two or three applications. My skin did not feel irritated by the product and there was no fragrance that I could detect from the liquid blush. I would be open to trying their other shades since I did not have an itchiness or irritation occur when using this product. It has a pull off cap and then you twist it to the right for the “on” position and squeeze gently to get the liquid blush out. The cushiony tip feels gentle on the skin as you are applying it. When you are done applying the blush, remember to turn it to the “off” position to avoid having extra product come out when its in a makeup bag or any other method of storage.","8 Mar 2023","Feels lightweight and doesn’t transfer","intriceblog"

The fluffy applicator felt soft, but it had a tendency to apply to much blush. It would also be hard to clean the applicator, so eventually your foundation and sunscreen will get on the applicator. I didn’t have any issue with the reddish, slightly pinky coral color of Dream Pop, but it could easily be built up into a very pigmented color. Perfect for those with a complexion darker than a cappuccino!

I found the consistency to be very sticky and tacky, so the blush itself would sometimes pull up while I was trying to blend it. (See my hand for an example.) I had to pick small pills of blush off my face today when applying the blush just over sunscreen. I had better luck applying with my ring finger (as opposed to a foundation sponge or cream blush brush) and slowly building the color up to my preferred vibrancy on top of foundation and powder. It never built up enough coverage to cover freckles, but did get to a nice flushed blush look quickly. I only had one instance where I thought the blush faded prematurely.

Given the texture and tendency to smear, drag, and sit on top of my cheeks, I would not recommend this blush to makeup newbies. If you wanted to try a liquid blush with a locking cap for travel and soft applicator, but didn’t want an in your face color, Dream Pop may not be the color for you- try the other shades of this product.

A little goes a really long way. All you need is one little dot for each cheek for a beautiful, natural finish. That said, it’s easy to get from 0 to clown in seconds. I recommend putting it on the back of your hand before blending onto your cheeks, so you can better control the amount you apply. The finish is matte, even for oily skin. However, I dont think drier skinned people would have issues with it being too dry.  I don’t think the sponge applicator is ideal, as over time it would be unsanitary. I suppose it could be washed, but this should really be a squeeze tube opening. Turning it does lock it in the off position, but the product that is already on the sponge tip stays there. Plus, the applicator isn’t practical for blending. I thought I would also try this I’m on my lips, but I don’t think it’s the right consistency for that.

It was extremely pigmented; a very little goes a long way. I needed only a tiny dot. I probably needed a different shade, a lighter pink would do better for my complexion and make up style. I found it easy to apply (just a tiny dab) and I liked the applicator quite a bit. The top was tricky to get off the first time, but I figured it out. This blush wand really gives my winter skin a nice healthy glow. I recommend, but make sure you get the right shade. Start small; you can always add more.

You have to work very quickly with this product though. One cheek at a time and slowly build to your desired color.

I’m loving how easy this cream blush applies and how buildable it is… I’m hoping it lasts a while but I’m not positive at .4 oz - would need to compare to other liquid blushes. I also love that it’s not easy to accidentally apply too much on the first go around because of how blendable it is and the pigment seems to melt into the skin while not overpowering with too much color right off the bat. I’m not trying to look like a clown here. I really want to get another because I’ve been into to using multiple shades of blush at the same time to create a custom look with more dimension. 10/10 would recommend.","8 Mar 2023","Loving this buildable dream blush!","CarrieWM"

Tbh, I don’t usually wear a ton of “color” and always reach for more muted and neutral colors. I thought this blush wand would end up in a pile to collect dust, but surprisingly I’ve been reaching for it ever since I received it.

One dot at a time! The blush is highly pigmented, blendable, and buildable. Dot, but don’t drag, the cushiony applicator across the skin. One dot is all you need on each side to add a bit of color to your cheeks. Once blended into the skin, Peach Pop looks very natural and “nude peach” would be an accurate description of the color.
 
The packaging is gorgeous. The sleek, peach colored tube combined with the golden cap, makes the blush wand look high end. The only thing that would have made it better is a screw on cap. The cap is a little bit hard to press onto the tube and if it isn’t complete secured to the tube, it easily falls off and you’ll end up with dried up blush on the applicator.","8 Mar 2023","","SMolina1175"

I think I just don’t rock with liquid blush. I find cream blush easier to work with. 

With that in mind, here’s what I liked and disliked about this particular product: 

Likes:
- The packaging is great. I love the ability to switch it to the “off” position so that if you keep it in a bag and it gets squished, it won’t end up causing spills
- That it’s buildable from sheer to opaque even if I had some trouble trying to find the right amount of color pay off

Dislikes:
- The peach was just too orange for me
- i found it hard to blend without blending it away — and then applying more would end up being too much blush. It was hard to get the right amount for the color pay off I wanted.","7 Mar 2023","It’s alright, I guess","egl17"

The first time I tried it I looked like a clown because I used way too much. A little goes a long way! Small dab and then blended with a beauty blender. It blended easily and dried down nicely! The packaging takes getting used to because of the way the blush comes out of the sponge applicator. The second time I used it, I opened the cap and there was blush all over the inside.

I was EXTREMELY excited to get this, but I would not let me getting it for free sway my review, so I made sure to try it several different ways to make sure I loved it just as much as my other favorite liquid and cream blushes regardless of price. 
I have really dry skin and I live in Las Vegas, so I was fearful that a matte blush was not going to do well on my skin, but I worried for nothing! Regardless of how I applied this, whether it was on my bare dry skin (as shown in the picture), over a Tinted Moisturizer/BB Cream, or on a foundation with more coverage this applied easily and wore well. I like that it just seemed to look like a natural flush and had a skin like finish, it didn't dry down too matte or powdery, and it felt like nothing on the skin. It also lasted well without getting patchy as it wore. I found the best way to apply it was dotting it directly on one cheek at a time, and then lightly blending it out with a beauty blender. It is easy to work with, didn't dry down too quickly but did dry down completely once I got it to where I liked it, and it didn't lift my base with this method. One layer left it looking very natural like in the picture shown, or I could easily apply multiple layers to build it up. 
I gave it 4 stars because of the price and color. While I do love this product, I think you could dupe it with something cheaper, but you are paying for the ease of use because I find this easier to apply than a lot of the similar blushes at least with the way I applied it. I also liked that the packaging, but I do think that the sponge top may get really dirty especially for those that wear a more full coverage foundation. Also, I got the shade Pink Pop which was a bit more peachy than I expected. It's still a pink shade and I like it, but I could imagine people expecting a true pink shade being disappointed.","7 Mar 2023","Great! Even for Super Dry Skin!","JeanJean84"

It is truly PINK POP PERFECTION in a tube!!! This is seriously gorgeous! The color is a perfect peachy-pink shade that gives you a pop of natural color. It's highly pigmented, blends effortlessly, plus a tiny bit goes a long way! I like applying it to my fingers first then blending it out with a blush brush (focusing on the apples of the cheek then back towards the hairline). My mom was equally obsessed so I'm going to have to buy a replacement tube now! It's kind of pricy at $42 but I imagine this will last me for forever! It also seems to be very resistant to water & long-wearing... the swatch I made on the back of my hand lasted all day through several hand-washings so I love its longevity!

The applicator was nothing like I had seen before.  After taking the lid off, you turn the top and squeeze the tub lightly until you see some color appear.  You only need a very small amount - a little goes a LONG way.  This is a pretty bold color for me so I only needed a small amount.  It blended well (used my fingers) and lasted long!

I give the tube a little squeeze and then dab a few dots on my cheeks, then blend and you’re finished! A little goes a long way, even with the light pink color I selected. I have found that one squeeze is enough for at least 3 days of application, which means this tube will last a while. The blush itself blends very well and dries with a matte finish.

I'm not a big fan of sponge type applicators because they either drag my base around (if I'm wearing one) or get kind of dirty after awhile. This one dispensed a good amount of product though, and I was able to tap it on rather than dragging it across my face. However... I had a really hard time blending the color out, both over a foundation and on bare skin. I see a lot of reviewers DIDN'T have this problem so maybe it's an issue with my body chemistry. But after trying my fingers and 3 different brushes, I just couldn't get it to be anything but patchy on me. Oh well!

It blends well and can be as subtle or as bold as you want depending on how much you add.

After trying this blush, I realized it wasn't the color for me as it was very bright red, looked a tad clownish and also it was difficult to blend I am assuming because it's matte?
First I tried it over my makeup which included powder already just because I was so excited when I got it but I already had a full face of makeup on, I tried blending it with my fingers, a beauty blender, and a brush and nothing prevented it from looking super spotty. Then, I tried applying it on top of clean bare skin with only concealer under my eyes and it was easier to blend but still looked spotty, even after applying with my fingers.","4 Mar 2023","","amorette21"

I hadn't tried a CT wand before so I was a little apprehensive that it would be messy or difficult and it does have a learning curve but it's not as bad as I was expecting. Make sure you turn the dial when you're not dispensing and blend quickly. With that being said, this shade on my skin tone seemed to blend away to nothing so I needed to build it up with a few applications and this formula does build easily without getting streaky. Once it's in place it is a very pretty shade with a natural looking finish. I will say I felt the Pink Pop shade was more peachy than I was expecting from the pictures.","4 Mar 2023","","katelynnmw"

This is my first time using Charlotte Tilbury's cosmetic product. I have known that they are a great brand with great cosmetic products and that's why I was so excited when I was chosen. I received the pink pop shade and I really like this liquid blush matte. The texture looks creamy but actually it's lightweighted. It is very easy to use and with the built-in applicator,  you can control how much you want to use. Just 1 dot for a natural flush and 2-3 dots for an intensified blushing look. I use a brush to help spread the color and it blends easily and evenly on my skin, it gives a flawless color and lasts throughout the day. It's a very good price for the quality of the product you get. Highly recommend!!","4 Mar 2023","A must have one!!","adamsdewi"

All my thoughts are my own and my honest feelings about the product. I really enjoy Charlotte Tilbury products and was very excited to receive this blush. I'm over 40 with dry skin and have really been into cream/liquid products especially during the winter so this blush came at the perfect time! It's a very pretty peachy pink that complimented my fair cool/neutral skin well. It's matte and very pigmented. You only need a small dot. I found the best way to apply was putting a dot on the back of my hand and using a medium density fluffy blush brush. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the spongy tip (like the Maybelline age rewind concealer tip). They aren't my favorite as I feel they get very messy and if you try to wash them it seems you lose a lot of product. Otherwise another great product from Charlotte!","3 Mar 2023","Beautiful","sjianniney"

So to discover that this blush went on beautifully - better than all my powder blushes combined lol!!! And it blended so easily and nicely!! I was so happy and impressed to find out I was wrong about cream blushes. I have been wearing it every day - even though I work from home.

It's so soft and creamy. The color is very vibrant with some peachy/coral in it too. It’s a really pretty color but I think but it is a little dark on my skin tone. I have to use it very lightly. I absolutely LOVE the sponge applicator and it blended out easily using my makeup brush. I would definitely try this again, just in a lighter tone.

This is my new favorite blush! It looks alarmingly bright when first applied but once blended has a very natural, matte finish that is buildable if you want a more noticeable look. It does dry pretty quickly, so don’t wait to blend. I love the design of blush wand as well, you can turn the top to close it so no worries if leaks if you throw it in your bag. It lasts all day, no need to reapply. A simply gorgeous blush and a new staple in my daily makeup routine!","2 Mar 2023","My new favorite blush!","Dayna1225"

So much so that if you’re a pale gal like me you should probably pass on this blush. A little bit goes a long way so I could easily see this product lasting forever. It dries quickly & lasts all day so blend quickly to avoid the clown look. It layers easily over liquid foundation. I docked a star because it applies super patchy which can make it easy to overdo wether blending with brush or fingers.

It comes in a wand  with a pillow-like applicator, which is similar to a make-up blending sponge. The shade I received (Dream Pop) is a saturated red which could be worn sheer and well blended, but was also buildable for more saturated color. The swatches shown are straight from the applicator and the right one is after very light blending. With this saturated color I liked to use a brush to blend the color, but I imagine with a lighter shade the blending could be accomplished using the applicator alone.  I would recommend this product!","28 Feb 2023","Buildable cream blush, innovative application","lifebynicole"

Also, I wish they would use a different applicator cause this one isn’t very hygienic but I do really like that you can lock the tube so it doesn’t accidentally leak.

The Charlotte Tilbury wand is a liquid matte formula blush in a sponge applicator tube. It is available in four shades: Pink Pop, Peach Pop, Pillow Talk, and Dream Pop. I received the Dream Pop blush wand for my independent review. 

The wands are user-friendly. You dab the sponge applicator directly onto your skin and blend out the product with either your fingers, beauty sponge, or makeup brush. The formula is creamy, and thick and blends easily and seamlessly.  I found the pigments to be rich so it didn't take much of the product to create an airbrushed skin finish. 

Using the product was a little awkward at first because it said to twist it to open it but failed to mention the ""on/off"" twist on the wand. After removing the cap, make sure the wand is switched from ""off"" to ""on."" From there, squeeze the tube until a small amount of product can be seen on the cushion applicator. Next, dab the blush onto the apple of your cheeks to add a bit of color. (One dab is enough for a lighter skin tone to get the desired pigmented finish.) The final step is to blend everything upward and outward for a lifted look. When you're finished, make sure to switch the wand ""off"" to avoid any spillage or leaking in your makeup bag or vanity. 

PROS: The natural glow and lightweight formula won me over. The color can be blended to perfect dewy flush without looking too overdone. The formula states to be long-lasting and I found this to be so. I never found myself needing to reapply throughout the day. I've honestly never come across another product that melts onto my skin in such a buttery-soft way. 

CONS: The cap was a little hard to get back on the tube. I could foresee myself forgetting to switch the applicator to ""off"" before attempting to cap the product, and accidentally getting a bunch of blush everywhere.","25 Feb 2023","Deep Matte Color that POPS!","H3Ranch"

I had a bit of hard time determining exactly how much product was needed due to the fact that you squeeze the bottom and you cannot see how much product came out.  The blush itself was a nice consistency and blended in easily but I found the color, Pink Pop, to be peach/coral for me.   For the right skin tone, it’s a beautiful color and the pigment of the color is great! I found the blush to be long wearing as it stayed put for over 10 hours.

Unlike most charlotte tilbury products it leaves a matte finish which is great for people prone to oily skin.

I love the formula of these, they’re a luminous matte finish that blend out beautifully - very creamy. No patchiness, just even colour and pigmentation.  The color I received, Dream Pop, was a little too red/intense for my very fair skin. It would probably work better for someone with a slightly darker skin tone. I would recommend but watch the shade you pick!","24 Feb 2023","","sabellee"

It's not an appealing look. As for this matte formula, it's not my preference. The colors are fine. What I really dislike is the packaging.

The color when blended out gives a beautiful glow to the skin without being overpowering or shimmery. The only gripe I have is that I do not understand the purpose of the packaging. If you squeeze product into the puff, even a little, it distributes waaaaay too much. So right now I squeeze some in and do one dab a day on each cheek until there’s none left and only then do I squeeze some more in. Seems inefficient.","21 Feb 2023","","gabby71884"

The color - Pillow Talk Pink Pop- was a beautiful color on my cheeks and was so easy to use. At first, I tried it directly on my cheek from the wand but found that to be too much for my fair coloring. Using a cream blush brush and tapping the applicator was a better way to use the product for me. A little goes a long way! With that said, the wand does not seem full and I would be very disappointed if I paid for this and only received a barely filled tube. This is a great product, I just wish there was more of it!","21 Feb 2023","Beautiful matte pink and easy to use","pinklibrarian"

I was sent the color Peach Pop. Inspired by Charlotte's best-selling beauty lights wand, this long wearing formula actually surprised me quite a bit! Other products I've tried like this have left me rolling my eyes and throwing it promptly away. Not this one! Not only is the color beautiful, not only does it have a very nice wand that can be turned on and off, eliminating the typical mess or drying out of  product (see the photos) but it blends out so easily! It does dry down super fast so I'd suggest doing one side at a time. I put 2 small dots on each side. Not allowing product to fill the whole tip. Then I used my fingers tips to lightly tap to blend. Then I added a little bit (emphasis on little) to the tip of a beauty sponge and blended some more on towards my nose to make a ""W"". I then took one of my @rephr.to brushes to lightly continue the blend so it blended out the color as you see in the pictures. It may sound like a lot of work, but it isn't once you do it. I just broke it down into words to make it more understandable. And it is buildable. You can have a flush of color or continue to add and lighting blend (just don't overblend or you will blend it away) until you get it to the color you desire. This one is definitely a 4 out of 5 for me. And only a  4 because of the fact it dries down so quickly.

* Even though this product was sent to me in PR, my opinions are always honest and based on my experience with the products. Your experience may have different results based on your skin type, condition and usage. I was not paid to do this review*

Definitely a must-have for spring. Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush is easy to apply and blends flawlessly on natural skin, powder, and foundation. I love the sponge applicator and the “dot and blend” application process It creates a natural looking tint without leaving a powdery finish on my skin. I thought this Peach Pop color might be a bit too bright for my fair complexion, but it gives a beautiful and natural looking glow! Long lasting, but easy to remove.","20 Feb 2023","Part of my spring makeup routine","ErichaL"

From first look, I was a bit confused as to how I would feel about this. It is a squeeze tube with a white, pillowy, soft brush applicator. You squeeze the blush product out and it comes out from behind the brush applicator. The color is very vibrant at first glance, similar to a coral hue. The blush consistency is oily and thin. I decided to dab the brush onto the backside of my hand and then apply it either with my finger or beauty blender (both worked out well to be honest although I usually don’t make a habit of applying any makeup with my fingers). The blush surprisingly had a matte finish although it definitely did not look like this at first, being that it was oily and shiny on my hand. Ultimately, I was concerned this would not work for me as I have oily skin and oily products usually just wear off quickly. However to the contrary, this was exactly the opposite. Not only did it not look oily or feel oily once applied onto my face, it felt hydrating and lasted very long. It didn’t even budge throughout the day! I actually am very impressed by how light this felt and how it was matte but not drying. It blended so well with my make up and looked very natural. The shade worked well with my medium skin tone. It was definitely more subtle than it first looked, and just gave the right hint of color. I am very pleased with this overall and do recommend this blush.","19 Feb 2023","Long lasting","msosa61890j"

I genuinely wanted to love this, as I do all my Charlotte Tilbury products but I don’t. 

I received the Pink Pop shade and while I am fair, this totally blended out and I had to have multiple layers to build up the color. When I did that, it became splotchy.

It lasts on the skin and is easy to blend out. It comes on a dab applicator that is plush and easy to use. 

I am giving it a 4 out of 5 because of the color. The dream pop is a cherry red that will work on medium to darker skin tones as a good flush of color. On someone who is extremely fair like me, it is a little overpowering. I used maybe half a dab for both of my cheeks, and it looks like my cheeks are really flushed, even after trying to blend it into my skin.","18 Feb 2023","A good product, watch the shade","ruddcatha"

It’s highly pigmented and you only have to use a couple dots to get a bright fresh look. It’s light as a feather and leaves a pretty glow also. I’ve always used powder blushes, but found that these look way more natural. The pink pop is very pink, but it’s a perfect springtime blush for me. I will definitely be purchasing in the future.","16 Feb 2023","Fresh and natural glow!","Stthomasmommy"

The wand applicator is easy to use.  While the product is “matte”, it’s not as flat-looking as powder blush.  Doesn’t apply heavy, easy to blend out, but if needed, also able to build up color.  While it doesn’t apply heavy, it does require more product (versus ex Rare Beauty) to get a darker color, but great for natural looks.","16 Feb 2023","Blendable, easy to apply","beccaaat16"

A little goes a long way and it’s very buildable. It’s matte but not in that old school chalky matte way.  I received Dream Pop, and it’s  a bright pop of color that absolutely looks natural. It give a flush that makes you glow. It’s creamy and simple to apply. One dot for a little blush, two for that perfect after workout or post naughty time flush. If you want less intensity, apply to your hand then prime your brush with it and use circular motions to apply onto the cheeks. I love it on the lips too!

It’s the same wands you love with a different finish! I’m wearing shade “Peach Pop” and it’s just perfect for anyone with warm undertones. The packaging is stunning AS ALWAYS 🤩✨and there is a generous amount of product in the tube. I found that this matte version was actually much easier to blend in then the original ones; this new formula is much more pliable whereas sometimes if I don’t apply the original in the right spot it can be a bit trickier to blend out. I would recommend these to CT current fans as well as those who have maybe wanted to try a beauty wand but have been hesitant too.

I laid it on much heavier in the photo I’m in black, and it was still gorgeous! Perfect for everyday. So easy to blend, obsessed. Perfect for both a casual look and evening look.","13 Feb 2023","Obsessed!","leahiamwbakelew"

The formula is ok as a liquid/cream blush. Nothing too revolutionary compared to everything else in my collection. The colour is good...

The blush goes on smooth and is really easy to blend. The color is beautiful and super buildable. It lasts all day and I have not noticed any transfer at all. 

The tube that the product comes in is made out of a lower quality plastic and feels a bit cheap. I would compare it to the expected quality of a drug store brand. The applicator tip while super soft is a bit small for the intended use. I have found myself needing to use a separate brush or sponge in order to properly blend the blush in. 

Overall I am a fan and would likely purchase in the future especially to try out all the colors!","12 Feb 2023","Buildable blush with great color!","nikki271682"

Being 57 years old, I have been trying to mainly purchase cream or liquid blush, and the Charlotte Tilbury formula is terrific...not too dry and not too runny. It blends perfectly with my finger, and looks very natural. 
I received the peach color, and when I first saw how it looked when I went to apply it, I was worried that it might be too orange, but I was wrong. I love the color on me!! It looks so youthful, pretty and natural, and feels amazing! 
I am definitely a Charlotte fan for sure now!","11 Feb 2023","Amazing!","BarbJWSD"

If you like liquid blushes, I think you’ll really like this one. It is VERY concentrated so you only need a tiny (and I mean tiny) bit for your cheeks. I’m wearing Dream Pop which is a vibrant, deep, cool cherry. After you twist off the cap, make sure the arrow is pointed to the ON position then give it a little squeeze so it floats up to the sponge tip. I didn’t read the directions carefully and kept trying to squeeze it in the OFF position 😂. What can I say? It’s been a long week! This blends very easily without feeling or looking greasy or dewy. I like the convenience of the tube because it easily fits into your makeup bag and it’s secure. This is long wearing, cruelty free and free of Sulfates SLS and SLES. As of right now, there are only three colors in the line but I’m sure as time goes by, there will be more added depending on its popularity. The price is a little high in my opinion ($42) but it is a premium brand.","11 Feb 2023","Pop of Color","Ihatepms"

While the packaging is beautiful, I was a bit skeptical of how this would apply with a sponge wand tip. I thought for sure too much product would end up on my face especially since the product came out of the tube and was incredibly pigmented. Well I’m pleasantly surprised! Only a few light taps with the applicator on my cheekbones, followed by some tapping with my fingers to gently spread out and blend the product, and my blush looks just gorgeous on my cheeks. I think I actually prefer the formulation to cream sticks just because of how beautifully and seamlessly it blended out. The matte formulation isn’t too dry or flat at all, and the peach color is the most gorgeous coral hue on my light neutral skin tone. Lasted all day on me too without fading, which can happen when I use cream based. Such little product was used this will last a while. While the tub doesn’t feel like it was filled full, I still believe I will get months of daily use out of this. I am a big fan of other Charlotte Tilbury products I’ve tried, and I think this will be another love as I continue to use.","9 Feb 2023","A peachy win","Pocahontas14"

It is not cakey and it does not dry out the skin.","7 Feb 2023","A little goes a long way","NLD6818"

This is probably the only liquid blush I have that doesn’t settle into pores, and looks completely natural, like flushed skin. It blends beautifully without streaks or bald spots, and a little goes a really long way. It also lasts throughout the day without sliding around. Peach Pop is a wonderful color too. Somehow, I don’t know how, but it does give me glow, without any shimmer. It’s truly a glowy peach that makes me look refreshed and healthy.

When I dotted my cheekbones with peach pop I got a little nervous because it was much more pigmented than I had anticipated but it blended in the most beautiful natural flush. I added a couple more layers to see how the formula builds and I was able to create a dramatic look but because the formula is a softer matte it still looked light and skin-like. This stayed out and didn’t break down my skin tint for the 10 hours I had it on. This will be a staple in my makeup bag especially for this summer. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.","6 Feb 2023","From natural to glam","jaylee"

I gravitate toward cream face products. Bronzer, highlight, blush, etc so this is right up my alley. When I first received it, I thought that the amount of product was sparse. BUT after trying it, I realize this will go a long way because you just need the tiniest dab. It looks intense when you first apply, but it blends out nicely. You do need to move quickly when blending otherwise it dries down and doesn’t budge. Staying power is excellent. Love the matte color. The wand twists to lock the product in. I didn’t notice that at first and kept squeezing with no result. Thought my wand was broken. Lol. I do appreciate that you can lock the wand so product doesn’t spill while traveling, etc. I would like to try another color in this and may purchase others. I like the convenience and ease of using these.","6 Feb 2023","Easy to Use & Apply","sylsbag"

I have to admit i had mixed feeling and was a bit skeptical to be completely honest. I was shocked by how smooth and matified the blush actually turned out to be. I love how simple the applicator is and that it has an open amd close action so you can adjust the amount of blush you want to use.

It blends really well, and applies nicely. I didn’t notice that it moved my foundation, or caused any shifting. My only issue is that I am very fair, so this color is a bit too deep for me. That isn’t to say that you can’t make it work, but it does take a lot of blending. Another note is that because it is a matte formula, it dries down quickly, so I would work on one side of the face at a time.","6 Feb 2023","Beautiful blending, dries quickly.","tcreativeblonde"

The color is beautiful and so easy to apply and blend with a BeautyBlender. However the color was subtle, even on my pale skin, so some users might want to build up the tone with layers. Feels like nothing on the skin. Would be perfect for ""no makeup-makeup"" looks. 
Also the tube leaked a little bit which is odd considering the design allows you to turn it ""off.""","6 Feb 2023","Gorgeous but Subtle","MLalexis"

It was super easy to use, just a simple twist and gentle squeeze and the product came to the applicator. I placed three dots on each cheek and blended with a brush as it gave me best results in the past with liquid blush. I’m convinced this shade is perfect for every single skin tone, It gave me the most perfect natural flush to my cheeks, which I was pleasantly surprised with as I had been using pink/ peach toned blush’s for years. It lasted me all day long and even showed up on camera in all my zoom meetings where I got lots of compliments from peers. Didn’t need any touch ups throughout the day.
